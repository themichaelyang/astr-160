<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> We've been talking about the Type
I<i>a</i> Supernovae and the data that they provide about the expansion
and, as it turns out, acceleration of the Universe. And so, one way to
summarize all that information is that what we have found out--we now
know that the Universe is accelerating, not just expanding, but
accelerating. And that acceleration comes about because of some kind of
dark energy--or to turn it around, the label we give to whatever is
calling that is dark energy. And this sometimes gets summarized by this
quantity, which is the energy density of the dark energy relative to
the critical density of the Universe. And the fact that it's
accelerating means that this quantity must be greater than this other
quantity, the density of matter, because the matter tends to pull
things together.</p>

<p>And so, we know not only that it's accelerating, we know something
about how much it is accelerating, and that tells us how much bigger
the dark energy density is than the matter density. And we kind of know
by how much. We kind of know how much bigger this is than the dark
matter density.</p>

<p>But somebody actually asked the question that, you know, I keep
saying, well, this is like 3/4, and this is like 1/4. If you add a
bunch of matter, couldn't you just add a bunch of dark energy also, and
end up with the same amount of acceleration? So, a comparable Universe.
And the answer is, yes, you could. There's nothing in the supernova
data that prohibits this from being .5 and this from being 1, as long
as this is sufficiently greater than that by the amount necessary to
give rise to the observed acceleration.</p>

<p>And so, if you plot these two quantities against each other--so,
here's, kind of, 0, 0. Actually, this can be negative, but let's not go
there.</p>

<p>1, 1. What you find out is that there's a kind of allowed region
that sort of looks like this, allowed by the supernova data. Notice,
this is--I'm assuming throughout that the dark energy really is the
Cosmological Constant. I'm not thinking about Big Rip scenarios at the
moment, because that would add a third dimension to this plot, and I
don't want to do that just yet. So, this is all assuming that dark
energy is the Cosmological Constant. But that's certainly a place to
start. There's no reason not to do that.</p>

<p>And so, I've been kind of consistently claiming, as we've been
talking about the course, that the real answer is somewhere like here.
Yeah? That it's about .3 on the matter side, .25 and about 3/4, 2/3,
3/4 on the dark energy side. But, in fact, you could go--as far as the
supernova care, you could have no matter at all and just a little dark
energy, or you could have a lot of matter and a huge amount of dark
energy. And you'd get the amount of acceleration, and therefore,
satisfy the observational constraints.</p>

<p>But, in fact, it turns out, we know more than this, because there
are other constraints on cosmology besides the supernovae. And, I have
to tell you at this point that this course, the way I've presented it,
is a little bit lopsided, because the other ways of constraining these
two quantities are just as important as the supernovae, and I'm going
to do them all in one lecture. And this is kind of in the spirit of the
philosophy of this course, where we try and understand a few things in
depth, rather than many things in breadth. But I'm going to talk about
two other kinds of constraints on cosmology today, which are, in fact,
just as important to modern cosmology as the supernovae are.</p>

<p>I like the supernovae, first of all, because they were the first
evidence of dark energy. I still think they're the best evidence of
dark energy. But it's also true that I think they're, in some ways, the
easiest to understand. That's not quite right. What I mean is that you
don't need a whole bunch of physics to understand what's going on,
because it's just the expansion of the Universe, whereas some of these
other things, as you will see, there's moments where I'm going to have
to say, and then there's a whole bunch of complicated physics, and
then, you get the result. And so, it's less satisfying to teach, and
perhaps to learn, in a course like this, but equally important for
modern cosmology. And what these other things do is they pick out where
in the allowed region--region allowed from the supernovae, the real
Universe actually is. Okay.</p>

<p>So, with the understanding that either of the two things I'm about
to talk about could have been five weeks of this course, let's move in
and I'll try and explain, in brief, what these things tell us about the
Universe.</p>

<p>The first is the Cosmic Microwave Background. This, we've
encountered before. This was one of the proofs that the Big Bang really
happened, as opposed to the "steady state." And, I don't know if you
remember what we said about that, so, let me remind you. Recall what
was going on. You're looking back in time as you look far away. So, as
you look back, things are denser and hotter. And if you look back far
enough, they get really hot.</p>

<p>So, let us imagine, we're looking at a redshift not of 1 or .8 or
something like that, but at a redshift of 3,000. So, this is when the
Universe was--the scale factor of the Universe was 3,000 times smaller
than it is today. At that time, the average temperature of the
Universe, about 10,000 degrees. Turns out, that's an interesting
number, because 10,000 degrees is how hot it has to be for hydrogen to
ionize. Ionization, you'll remember, is when the electrons disassociate
with the protons, and then, you just have a whole bunch of charged
particles moving around. And it turns out--so, before that, when the
temperature is higher than this, you imagine that the entire Universe
is basically filled with all this ionized hydrogen.</p>

<p>One of the features of ionized hydrogen, or indeed, charged
particles, generally, is that they tend to be opaque. Photons don't
propagate well through these things. Photons propagate well through
neutral materials but not well through charged materials. So, before
that, the Universe was opaque. It's like looking at the surface of a
star or a big wall of opaque gas. You can't see any further. So, it
can't look back any further than that. But if you look in any
direction, and you're looking far enough away, you ought to see a big
wall of 10,000-degree hydrogen.</p>

<p>And, in fact, we know what a wall of 10,000-degree hydrogen looks
like, because there are stars whose surfaces are 10,000 degrees. And
the Sun's a little cooler than that, but there are many stars that are
10,000 degrees. So, this should look like--so, in any direction you
look, you should see something that looks like the surface of a star:
hot ionized hydrogen. And this looks like the surface of a star.</p>

<p>And we know that that's wrong, right? You can--let's go outside and
look up in some direction. If this were really true, then anywhere you
look, you would see the surface of a star that's hotter and brighter
than the Sun. And so, the whole of the sky would look like the surface
of the Sun, only hotter. And obviously, that isn't the case. And the
reason that that's not the case is because you have to remember how
redshifted this is. It's redshifted by a factor of 3,000. So, the light
has wavelengths that's 3,000 times longer than the light we see from
stars.</p>

<p>So, let's work that out. You'll recall, λ that you observed is equal
to λ<sub>emitted</sub>, plus Δλ. Or, is equal to λ<sub>emitted</sub> (1
+ <i>Z</i>), because <i>Z</i> is Δλ / λ<sub>emitted</sub>. And so, this
is equal to the wavelength emitted, times 3,001, right? Here's the 1,
here's the 3,000. We'll call that 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>. And if the
wavelength that's emitted is a nice optical wavelength like 5 x
10<sup>-7</sup> meters, that looks green or yellow, times 3,000, that's
15 x 10<sup>-4</sup>. That's around 1 millimeter. Wavelengths of a
millimeter. Now, wavelengths of a millimeter, you don't see with your
eye. These are, more or less, what we call microwaves.</p>

<p>So, the prediction really is that in any direction you look, you see
a whole--you see what would have been something that looks like the
surface of a star, except it's redshifted so far that all you can see
is microwaves instead of ordinary optical light.</p>

<p>This is true. This has been verified observationally, first in the
1960s. This is true. There is a Cosmic Microwave Background in any
direction. Take a microwave detector, radio telescope. You point it in
any direction. You see this stuff coming from the Universe. And this
was taken, when it was first discovered, as evidence for the Big Bang
and against the steady state. Because it was predicted by the Big Bang,
because you assume that the Universe was much, much hotter and much,
much denser in the past, which is what you need in order to create this
stuff, and that by the time you're seeing it now, it's all
redshifted.</p>

<p>Okay, so that's fine, as far as it goes. One of the features of the
Cosmic Microwave Background turns out to be that it's very smooth. And
you expect that to be true, because you expect to see the exact same
thing in any direction. It doesn't matter if you go back in time
looking that way, or back in time looking that way. You expect the
Universe to be denser and hotter in the past and about the same way.
And so, sure enough, the Cosmic Microwave Background is pretty much the
same everywhere you look. Same everywhere.</p>

<p>And, as further experiments were done, it really is very smooth. And
it came--it started to-- the smoothness of this started to become a
little embarrassing, because it can't be--you don't want it to be
perfectly smooth. Absolutely, totally identical in all directions.
Because the Universe, at the moment, is not perfectly smooth. We've got
planets. We got people. We got galaxies. Then, we got big spaces where
there's nothing. And so, if the Universe, at the time of the Cosmic
Microwave Background, is going to evolve into our own Universe now,
there must be some little perturbations that are going to grow up to be
galaxies later on. If it were perfectly smooth then, it would have to
be perfectly smooth now, and that's manifestly not the case. So, you
suspect that there must be some irregularities, because the Universe
now is clearly irregular, in the sense that it contains objects of
various kinds.</p>

<p>And so, in the 1990s, it turns out, you can see microwaves from the
ground, but it's better to do it from space. And so, in the 1990s, they
launched a satellite called COBE. This is the Cosmic Background
Explorer. This is a satellite launched in the early 1990s. And COBE
finally found the variations in the Cosmic Microwave Background. And
they were very small, ten--1 part in 100,000. So, 10<sup>-5</sup> to
1.</p>

<p>Now, that contrasts with the variations we see in the current
Universe. In the current Universe, the variations in density can be 30
orders of magnitude, 10<sup>30</sup>. Remember, the average density of
the Universe is something like 10<sup>-27</sup> kilograms per cubic
meter. In here, we've got 10<sup>3</sup> kilograms per cubic meter.
That's the density of water, for example. And so, the density of the
Universe now varies by 10<sup>30</sup>, but then, it only varied by
10<sup>-5</sup>. So, the sixth decimal place in the density was found
to be variable. The first five were always the same.</p>

<p>Now, 10<sup>30</sup>. And so, that seems like this Universe is quite
different from this Universe. But there are ways that structure grows
and that, I'll come back to in a minute. That's the second thing I want
to talk about, is the growth of structure.</p>

<p>But, at least, there was some variation. People were very excited
about this, because this, again, is a situation where something was
predicted, and then, you build a complicated piece of apparatus, and
you see what you predict. And that's always a good thing to have
happen. That gives you confidence that you know what you're talking
about.</p>

<p>And in their excitement, a number of scientists became, sort of,
overexcited. There's a famous quote from Stephen Hawking. At the time,
he said--about the COBE results, he said it's like seeing the face of
God. This is a very dangerous thing to say, because, you know, most
people in the world don't understand how similes work. So, he said,
it's like seeing the face of God. And this was reported: Scientist Sees
God. So, you have to watch what you say. And, you know, the <i>Weekly
World News</i> got a hold of this and then it was trouble. All right.
So, they saw God by seeing the variations in the Cosmic Microwave
Background. Who knew? All right, now, then.</p>

<p>So, that was nice, but COBE was just the first crack at this. And,
while they saw variations, they didn't see it very precisely. It was a
pretty blurry image. So, then, there was another satellite, still
operating, actually, called WMAP. WMAP is the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe. So, anisotropy means irregularity. Wilkinson--Dave
Wilkinson was one of the pioneers of this kind of radio astronomy, and
he was the leader of this project until he died shortly before launch,
and so, then, they named it after him.</p>

<p>And then, in 2003, WMAP announced its results, and they got a much
more precise map of the Cosmic Microwave Background; so precise that
they could measure the size of these irregularities. Not just how
irregular they were, but how big they were. And that, it turns out,
gives you cosmological information. And I'll come back to that in a
second. But I want to start by showing you some pictures, here. Let's
see.</p>

<p>All right. This is the COBE results. So, let me explain what you're
looking at. What you're looking at is a map of the entire sky. They've
projected it onto the sky. And the way it works is this. Down the
middle here, that's the plane of the galaxy. That's where the Milky Way
is going to be. And then, any position on the sky maps onto this oval.
And so, this is a common way of expressing the whole sky. Now, this is
actually kind of the raw data, where red--I can't remember which way it
goes. I think red is slightly denser, or actually, slighter hotter, is
the way they measure it, and blue is slightly cooler.</p>

<p>So, there's this kind of yin-yang pattern here. And that's because
we're moving in some direction through the Universe. And so, if you
look at the Microwave Background in the direction we're moving, then
it's a little bit blueshifted, which makes it look a little bit hotter.
Whereas, if you look back where we're coming from, that's a little bit
redshifted, so it looks a little cooler. And so, we're moving in this
direction, away from here, and that effect--it's a very small effect of
our motion through the Universe--turns out to dominate the
irregularities in the Cosmic Microwave Background.</p>

<p>But, of course, that's not what we care about. We want to see what
the background itself is doing. It's also true that that's quite easy
to remove, because we know how fast we're moving. You can tell from
this what direction we're moving in, and also how fast. And you can
just take that out of the whole map, and adjust the map to be how we
would see it if we weren't moving anywhere. That looks like this.</p>

<p>And now, there's a clear signal. This is the Milky Way, here. There
are sources of microwaves that aren't the Cosmic Microwave Background.
They're objects in our own galaxy that emit a lot of microwaves. But
the thing is that the spectrum of the microwaves they emit is very
different from the spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background.</p>

<p>And so, if you take not just an image of this, but you take an
actual spectrum, which they did, you can tell the difference between
things coming--emission coming from the background, and emission coming
from actual objects in our own galaxy. And so, you can take out the
ones--you can artificially, digitally, remove the objects that have the
spectrum associated with galactic objects. And so, you can do that. You
can take this out. And that's what you end up.</p>

<p>I should say that the scale between red and blue changes by about a
factor of 10 between each one of these plots. And so, the difference
between red and blue, here, is much, much smaller than the difference
between red and blue up here.</p>

<p>Anyway, this was the face of God, according to Hawking, because it
wasn't smooth, and because you could, after some exhaustive error
analysis, convince yourself that you really believe that these pieces
of the Cosmic Microwave Background are actually hotter, and therefore
denser, than these pieces of the Cosmic Microwave Background.</p>

<p>So, that was a big triumph. And these irregularities, then, grow up
to be galaxies, or groups of galaxies, or groups of groups of galaxies,
because, you know, they're pretty big. They extend, you know, some
significant fraction across the whole Universe. This is, you know, a
map of the whole Universe, because it's mapping the entire sky. So,
they're not going to grow up to be individual galaxies, but they are
going to grow up to be irregularities in the Universe.</p>

<p>Okay, so now, this is COBE in the 1990s. To compare that to the WMAP
results. Here is, on a different visualization color scheme. WMAP
changed colors on us so that you wouldn't get confused between their
results and the COBE results. So, this is the COBE map again and this
is what WMAP saw.</p>

<p>And you can see that it's seeing the same things. This over-density
here, that's this stuff here. This over here, that's these, only it's
seeing it much, much, much more precisely. And, you know, it's kind of
the difference between a Hubble Space Telescope image and a
ground-based image. It's seeing the same thing, but the resolution here
is much, much higher. And you can see that you might have a chance of
measuring the size of some of these clumps in this image in a way that
you wouldn't be able to do in this image here. And so, that was what
WMAP was about, was actually measuring the sizes of these little bumps
in the Cosmic Microwave Background.</p>

<p>So, why is that a good thing to do? And here's where, if I had five
weeks, I'd explain that to you, but I don't, so I won't. So, let me
just say that from the sizes, you can get cosmological information. And
I'm not going to tell you how that works. Basically, it comes about
because if you--what you find out from this is that there are certain
sizes-- the clumps like to be certain sizes, and there are very few
clumps that are other sizes, so they're particularly favored sizes. And
the favored sizes turn out to relate to how old the Universe is at that
moment and what has been contained in the Universe up until then.</p>

<p>But I won't go into that in any more detail except to say that the
outcome of this is that what you constrain, what you find out from this
is what they refer to Ω<sub>tot</sub>, which is the sum of
Ω<sub>λ</sub> and Ω<sub>matter</sub>. And this turns out to be equal to
1, to as close as they've been able to measure it. It's about 10% by
now. One, probably plus or minus, I don't know, 0.1. It's maybe a
little better than that by now, a few percent.</p>

<p>But now, that's a very good thing to know. Because, remember what
this looked like from the supernovae alone. The allowed region of
the--so, here's 1 and 1. The allowed region of the supernovae looks
something like this. The Cosmic Microwave Background has these two
things equaling 1, and so, you force yourself to be on a straight line
that looks like that.</p>

<p>And so, the two of these experiments put together gives you a much
better constraint on what's going on. So, this is from the Microwave
Background. It's actually some kind of region that looks like this. And
so, now, you've got an allowed region that's much smaller than either
of these two experiments individually.</p>

<p>Okay, as I said, there's a third constraint and this comes about by
the growth of structure. You have to get from these tiny perturbations
that, after great effort, have been seen in the Cosmic Microwave
Background, those had better grow up to be galaxies or groups of
galaxies or something. So, at <i>Z</i> = 3,000 you have 10<sup>-5</sup>
perturbations. At <i>Z</i> = 0, you have 10<sup>30</sup> plus--even
greater than that, you know. Basically a black hole is infinitely
dense, so I guess you could have infinite perturbations, if you think
about it from that point of view.</p>

<p>And you've got to get from one to the other. So, how does this work?
Supposing you have a slight over-density. Well, what happens? The
region that is over-dense, a little denser than the stuff around it,
has more gravity than the surrounding regions. And so, it then pulls in
material from the neighboring areas, because the gravitational force on
any particular piece of mass will put it toward the place where the
matter is densest, because that's where the gravity is coming from.
Pulls in nearby material.</p>

<p>But, of course, that action makes it denser, because it's just
pulled in more stuff from the nearby region, and it makes the other
parts less dense. And so, this is a runaway process. Then, the denser
regions are denser still. They have yet more gravity. They pull stuff
in even faster. And so, you can start with tiny perturbations, and they
grow and grow and grow and grow, until it becomes the difference
between a galaxy and not a galaxy, or a group of galaxies. Turns out
that the--even on the WMAP plot, the kinds of perturbations we're
looking at are what's called large--this leads to the Large-Scale
Structure, which is distributions of galaxies and galaxy clusters.</p>

<p>So, there's individual galaxies. Galaxies like to live in clusters.
Turns out, the clusters are grouped together. That's the Large-Scale
Structure. And you can plot this by using--by doing galaxy surveys. And
the problem with the galaxy survey is, how do you know where it is in
the third dimension? How do you know how far away it is?</p>

<p>So, you have position in the sky. That tells you two of the
coordinates of a galaxy. And then, you measure its redshift. And you
use the redshift in order to make a guess at how far away it is, just
from using the Hubble Law. So, instead of trying to determine the
distance in order to measure the value of the Hubble Constant, you
assume a value of the Hubble Constant that you take from somewhere. And
then, if you measure--then, you can--and, once you've assumed the value
of the Hubble Constant, you can use redshift to tell you what the
distance is supposed to be.</p>

<p>And so, then, you get a 3D map of the sky, and that tells us what
the structure is now. You can then compare that to--you can then
simulate the growth of structure by computer. You start with the Cosmic
Microwave Background, with what you know about the Cosmic Microwave
Background. You apply the laws of gravity. And you can also put it in a
little dark energy if you feel like, to change how the--and that
actually does change how the growth works, as you might imagine. But
you can stick in any cosmological parameters you want, and just apply
them as the Universe grows from a redshift of 3,000 to now. And then,
you determine what the simulation looks like now, where now is defined
to be, you know, 13.7 billion years after you start. And you ask, does
it look alike? Look the same as the observations?</p>

<p>Now, along the way, when you're applying gravity in all this stuff,
you have to assume cosmological parameters--how much dark energy there
is, but especially, how much dark matter there is. Because, it's the
matter that's pulling these density perturbations together--how much
dark matter and some of its properties. And so, then, what you do is
you just run your computer program a whole bunch of times, over and
over again, with different amounts of dark energy, dark matter, and
stuff like that. And you see which one of these simulations produces a
Universe that actually looks like the one we see. So, which input
parameters give you the observations?</p>

<p>So, this is, in general, how computational science works. This is
how, you know, the big global warming models, all these kinds of things
of work this way. You put in as much physics, as much chemistry,
whatever, as you can understand. Make a big computer simulation. You
pick a set of starting conditions. In this case, that's easy, because
you observe the Cosmic Microwave Background. You run the thing for a
while, and you ask, does it look like real life? And to the extent that
it looks like real life, you believe that you've put in all the
important physics and all the important science into your
simulation.</p>

<p>Then you ask, all right, given the results of this simulation that
seems to represent real life, what does it predict? So, you can do
things, for example, in the global warming models, you add a whole
bunch of carbon to the atmosphere, and then you ask, now what's going
to happen? And with various results.</p>

<p>And so, this is a kind of example of a general kind of science that
is now more and more frequently being done--this kind of computational
simulation of reality, which you then check in some way against
reality. And then, to the extent that it works, you use it to predict
reality in other sets of circumstances.</p>

<p>So, let me show you some of that. All right. Here's a map of the
Universe. These are observations. This is a famous redshift survey. So,
what you've got is redshift going up this way, or actually, they
plotted in velocity and position on the sky in this direction. This is
kind of a slice of the Universe, so it's got no third dimension coming
out of the blackboard, because they just haven't used it. And, you can
see, each dot is a galaxy. They are not distributed randomly in this
plot. This little guy, here, is obviously hugely over-dense. And there
are also places--they think they're complete out to the edge here.
There are also places where they're almost no galaxies. These are
called voids. There are walls and voids.</p>

<p>And then, as they took more and more slices to build up the third
dimension, they ended up having things that look like this. And there
are clear over-densities at certain--this is named the Great Wall.
There are clear over-densities in some places and clear under-densities
in others. And it turns out that the Large-Scale Structure of the
Universe is sort of like a bubble, some soap bubbles.</p>

<p>And so, they've got walls, and then, there are voids in the middle
of the walls. And where those walls connect are particularly dense
clumps. Another way you can think about it is that there are these
kinds of these filaments, things that go through space where there are
unusually large numbers of galaxies.</p>

<p>So, the most recent redshift survey, which goes out much, much
further than the one I just showed you, that was the first. That one
sort of goes out to here. But now they've the 2DF, Two Degree Field.
This is a telescope that can look at--measure the redshifts of galaxies
within two degrees of each other all at the same time. So, you get
many, many redshifts. I think they have close to--maybe 100,000
redshifts. Here. Each blue dot is a galaxy.</p>

<p>And you can see the structure. You can see the structure really
cleanly with these void areas surrounded by walls. And then, when the
walls run into each other, there are particularly dense clumps of
galaxies. So, that's the current structure of the Universe that we want
our simulation to end up looking like. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Why does [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh, because after around here, they
stop being complete. They just don't see all the galaxies, because
there are faint ones that they can't measure. And so, beyond about
here, they're just not measuring all the galaxies that are there.</p>

<p>Okay, so now, let me show you a simulation. Let's see. Come on. Here
we go. All right. I'll come back and I'll tell you what you're looking
at in just a second. But here is the evolution of the Universe as done
by computer. All right. So now, let me--where are we starting from? The
redshift is up here. And so, we're going to go from a redshift of about
thirty, when the Universe was thirty times smaller than it is, to a
redshift of zero, which is today. And we're going to look at this box.
This is a little chunk of the Universe. Each one of these dots is
supposed to be a galaxy. Now, at a redshift of thirty, they're not
galaxies yet. They're just over-densities of gas.</p>

<p>Now, two things are going to happen, since a redshift has started by
now. One is that the box is going to get thirty times bigger. The whole
Universe is going to expand. And that is included in the simulation,
but we're not going to include it when we make the movie, because it
makes it hard to see what's going on.</p>

<p>And so, if you'll remember the coordinate system, the way it works
is there's this scale factor times <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>
position. We're taking the scale factor out. So, this box is a single
part of the Universe. It's going to expand by a factor of 30, but
you're not going to see the expansion here. All you're going to see is
the motion in <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z,</i> not the scale factor, as
these things moved toward each other.</p>

<p>Now, as you start out, it looks like it's pretty evenly distributed,
but, in fact, there are little perturbations in the density. And what
will happen is the galaxies will stream toward the perturbations and
the perturbations will get bigger. And the--keep track of redshift up
here. The rate at which the redshift changes, varies with time, because
what we're actually counting, here, is not redshift, but time steps.
And the relationship between time and redshift is not obvious.</p>

<p>So, let us take another look at the growth of structure, here. See
them all moving towards each other, collecting in these filaments,
abandoning whole regions into voids. And then, you end up--well, you
end up back where you started, the way this film loop works. But let me
show you a different visualization of exactly the same data.</p>

<p>You know, this is all on the computer. You can do anything you want.
They make these great things where you sort of fly through the Universe
while it's evolving and stuff. I don't think--That's amusing, but I
don't think it's very educational. One thing that is useful: they took
that box and they just kept rotating it as this film looped right
around it. And that's useful, because you get to see these structures
from different angles, and I think it makes it easier to visualize. So,
let's try that.</p>

<p>See, it's the same simulation, except the box is rotating, and so,
you get a better sense, I think, of what these structures actually look
like. I'll do it once more. As they collect into these filaments and
the filaments collect together. And so, what you can do with the output
of something like this, with what it is at the very end--whoops, I
missed. Try it one more time. Let me see if I can pause before it
gets--before it regroups.</p>

<p>All right. So, here is a small redshift. When you get to this point,
there are mathematical ways of saying, you know, how clumpy is it? How
stringy is it? And you can compare the results of simulations of this
kind with actual observations from the redshift surveys. And so, in
this particular case, it worked. So, let me go back to here--yes--oh,
it's down here--whoops. There we go. There, that's where I want to be
for the moment.</p>

<p>And the consequence of these kinds of things is, it turns out that
most, as I said before, mostly what you constrain, and so, you compare
the simulations to redshift surveys. And the consequence of that is
that you constrain the amount, and also, to a lesser extent, the type,
the behavior, of dark matter. Because it's the matter that's pulling
things together. And in a way, you can think about these little clumps
and filaments. That's places where the Universe has already stopped and
contracted. So, it had a little extra density. So, it hit--so, it was
beyond the critical density. And so, that little piece of the Universe
stopped and turned around, even though the Universe as a whole
continues to expand.</p>

<p>All right, so, now. What do we have? Let's go back to the plot.
There's 1. Here's 1. And so, we have the supernovae forcing you to be
in this box, here. We have the Cosmic Microwave Background forcing you
to be in this box, here. And now, we're going to have a straight
vertical line in this plot, because we know how much dark matter there
is from the structure simulations.</p>

<p>Now, there are two possibilities. Supposing it comes in here–this is
a good answer, because then, everything is consistent. Alternatively,
however, it could come in here. This would be awkward, because if it
came in there, there would be no answer that would simultaneously
satisfy all of these constraints. And so, then, something is wrong
either with one of these determinations of the cosmic parameters, or
with the theory as a whole. Could be either observational badness or
theoretical badness.</p>

<p>And remember one – you know, we did assume – in even making this
plot, you're assuming that you're dealing with a Cosmological Constant
as the form of the dark energy. And, as we discussed last time, it's
possible that it isn't constant, that it's something else. And so, if
you ended up--if these things didn't work, you'd have to ask yourself,
do I have any clue how the dark energy works? And the answer would be,
no, and you would kind of have to abandon the Cosmological
Constant.</p>

<p>I think that's the easiest way out if things don't work, because
dark matte--we don't know what it is, but we do know what it does. It
exerts gravity and pulls things together. So, no matter what the answer
to what it is, its gravity will still be the same. Dark energy--not
only do we not know what it is, we don't really know what it does,
except that at the moment, it's causing a certain amount of
acceleration.</p>

<p>And so, if you were satisfied that all the observations were right,
you might also think that your simulations have left out something
important. That could easily be that you don't fully understand how
structure evolves from a <i>Z</i> of 3,000 to now. That's certainly
true at some level, and so, there are various ways you could get out of
it.</p>

<p>But the nice thing about it is it's a test of cosmology. Basically,
if you have one measurement of two variables, the variables being the
amount of dark energy and the amount of dark matter, that doesn't tell
you--all that does is it establishes a relationship between the two
variables. It doesn't actually measure either one of them. And so, you
get some allowed region like this or this, but you don't actually make
a measurement.</p>

<p>If you have two measurements of two variable--if you think of it in
a mathematical sense, this is two equations and two unknowns. This you
can solve. So, then, you measure values for--well, in this case,
Ω<sub>λ</sub> and Ω<sub>matter</sub>. And that's nice. Then, you can,
you know, quote what the values are, once you've done this, to
however--whatever the precision of your measurement turns out to
be.</p>

<p>If you have three measurements of two variables, that's a test of
the theory, because it is not guaranteed that you'll get a consistent
result. In general, if you write down three lines in a two-dimensional
space, you don't pick out a single point, because they don't all cross
at the same place. And so, if they do, then you've got a consistent
result. And then, you have tested the theory because your prediction is
that all these three lines cross at the same place. They don't have to
do that. So, if you measure something and it works out that way, then
you've tested the theory and, kind of, come out on top.</p>

<p>So, let me end today's class by showing you the answer. This is what
we know about the Universe. Let's see, what have I done with my--oh,
there it is. This is the allowed region of the supernovae. And what
they've done is, in each of the cases, there's a sort of--I think it's
a one sigma region. So, there's a 2/3 chance it'll live inside here,
and a--;well, over 90% chance that it lives inside the broader
area.</p>

<p>So, the supernovae force you to be here. The Cosmic Microwave
Background is the green result and it forces you to be here. And then,
the clusters, Large-Scale Clustering, force you to be here, and they
cross. So, this is the big triumph. You've tested the theory by
measuring it in three different ways for two parameters--namely, the
dark energy density and the dark matter density.</p>

<p>Now, there are a couple other interesting things to note on this
plot. One is that, in some cases, the Universe expands forever, and in
some cases, it re-collapses. And we're well into the expansion region.
There's also the question of the geometry of the Universe. The more
stuff there is, either dark energy or dark matter, the more curved the
Universe becomes.</p>

<p>And so, you can ask yourself, is the Universe curved in such a way
that it curves back on itself? Is it basically flat, giving you
Euclidian geometry, or does it curve backwards and extend infinitely?
And that's these three situations, here. If the sum is equal to 1, then
the Universe is flat and Euclidian. And so, that separates these
two.</p>

<p>Now, as somebody pointed out a few classes ago, if you have too much
dark energy, then you never cross 0. And you never have a Big Bang,
because the acceleration has been so great that you must have started
out coming down and been bent up toward where we are now. That's this
region up here. No Big Bang. And so, we're well away from that as
well.</p>

<p>And so, this basically sums up what we currently know about the
expansion of the Universe. That we have a constraint going this way, a
constraint going this way, a constraint going this way. And you can see
why I say that in a kind of philosophical sense, all three of these
measurements are equally important, because it's the fact that you've
got three of them that allows a test of the theory.</p>

<p>And we've talked a lot about the supernovae. You could talk just as
much about the Cosmic Microwave Background or about Large-Scale
Clustering, and the comparison of simulations with redshift surveys. We
obviously aren't going to have time to do it, but this plot summarizes
what we know about the Universe. Okay, thanks.</p>
