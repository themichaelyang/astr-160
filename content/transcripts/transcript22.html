<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> We had gotten, at the end of last
time, to the Big Rip. This is where the ever-expanding Cosmological
Constant--which is, of course, a contradiction in terms. If you imagine
that dark energy is not a Cosmological Constant, that it's actually
increasing in time, rips everything to shreds. The Universe becomes
infinite in size in a finite amount of time and everything gets pulled
apart. What I want to start by doing today is to go back and do that
again slowly, okay? Because I think this is not a simple line of
reasoning that leads you to this.</p>

<p>So, let's go all the way back to what we know about the Universe
from observing galaxies, supernovas, things like that. We know that the
Universe is expanding and that, we know. Hubble already figured that
out. We know this from the Hubble Law, and from other--just, in
general, from the study of standard candles at relatively low redshift.
So, distances out to, I don't know, <i>Z</i> of less than 0.2, or so.
You can't tell the difference between an accelerating or a decelerating
Universe. All you know is that it's expanding, and you can figure out
how fast it's expanding.</p>

<p>Now, the next question then becomes the rate of expansion. Is the
rate of expansion changing? Is it accelerating? Is it decelerating?
What's going on there? And so, you want to compare acceleration versus
deceleration, which is a fancy word, as you know, for slowing down. And
deceleration: this is relatively easy to grasp. This is what happens
because of matter. Matter exists. It's got gravitational force, and
gravitational force tends to hold things together. So, if you've got
something that's moving apart, and there's some gravitational force,
it'll tend to hold it together, and thus, slow it down.</p>

<p>Most of the matter, it turns out, is this weird dark matter, which
we don't understand, but that's what's responsible for the
deceleration. If you're going to make it go faster, you need something
much weirder that pushes outward, that has repulsive force. This, we
believe, actually exists. This, we label dark energy. And so, the
question of, "is it accelerating or is it decelerating," is basically a
question of how much dark energy is there versus how much matter is
there, because the more--if you have more of this than this, then it
will accelerate and vice versa.</p>

<p>And what we have discovered by supernovae observations with
redshifts of greater than 0.3, and by now, out to about a redshift of
1, or so, demonstrate that--well, what exactly does this say? Let's go
slowly. In the past, the Universe was expanding more slowly than it is
now, and therefore--those three dots are the mathematical symbol for
therefore. Therefore, the Universe is accelerating, and therefore,
there's more dark energy than there is matter.</p>

<p>And you'll recall, we did the little pie chart of the Universe, and
it turns out, it's 3/4 dark energy and 1/4 matter. And those
proportions are determined by the rate at which the Universe is
accelerating. Not the rate at which it's expanding, but the rate at
which it's accelerating, because that's the change in the expansion.
Fine, so far--or maybe it isn't fine. I should pose that as a question.
Fine? This is the basic premise of where we had gotten to about a week
ago. Yes sir?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How does dark energy cause acceleration?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How dark energy [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> How dark energy causes
acceleration? Excellent question. I have no idea, because we don't have
any idea what it is. And it shows up-- the reason we have even a name
for it, you know, is that it showed up in Einstein's equations as a
potential contribution to the Universe that you could add, but didn't
have to. A constant of integration, for those of you who like that kind
of thing.</p>

<p>What it is, physically? Very hard to understand. The only physical
explanation that's been offered--well, many have been offered. But the
only one that connects to anything else we know is the idea that it's
the vacuum energy predicted by quantum mechanics. And it turns out that
if that's true, it ought to be 10<sup>120</sup> times stronger. And so,
that's not a good prediction.</p>

<p>And so, exactly how this works--what the mechanism is, what the
nature of this stuff is? Completely unknown. And the only reason we
think it's there is that we see its effect. We see the Universe getting
faster. And so, it's just a name that's attached to whatever is causing
that effect. Okay. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How do you know the Universe is expanding more
slowly?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Was expanding more slowly than it
is now, right. So, that is this transformation between these two
different kinds of graphs, one of which is the observed graph and one
of which is the plot of the scale factor versus time.</p>

<p>Here's now. Here's 1. We're at 1 and now. And so, if it were not
accelerating, if it were just coasting along, that would be a straight
line. And what happens is, we can look back into the past and what we
see is this. So, at this point, if you think about it--believe me, for
a sec, that this is true. Supposing you were sitting here. The rate of
expansion is the slope of this line. That's how much you're expanding.
And so, at this point, the slope is shallower than it is up here. And
so, one interpretation of this line is that in the past, it used to be
expanding, you know, like this, and now, it's expanding like this.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Ah, how do you know it's doing that
particular shape? Well, you, of course, observe points all along the
way, here. Now, we're about to get to the question of whether that
shape actually continues. If you asked, how do you know that it would
continue this way, that, of course, you don't know for sure. If you
invent some piece of magic whereby everything changes right now for
some obscure reason, it could go off in some other direction. But the
assumption is that whatever it is that's--that we do not live at a
special time, and that, therefore, whatever it is that's doing the
accelerating is going to keep at it. And indeed, the whole of the Big
Rip, which is where I'm going with this, comes about by asking the
question, supposing the acceleration rate is changing in a different
way from the way we thought it was going to.</p>

<p>Just to complete the thought here, the way this works out in the
observational plane, you'll recall, looks like this. Here's the empty
Universe in this set of units. And you observe a bunch of supernovae
and they seem to be doing that. And that line, if you, then, transform
redshift and distance--this is kind of a weird measure of
distance--into scale factor and time. Let me make this line solid, so
that the two graphs correspond. This line and that line correspond with
each other. And so, as you observe many points along here, that's
essentially observing many points along here. Okay, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Given the empirical data that we know now, if we
were to extra--to improve to extrapolate that curve, would it actually
intersect with the <i>t</i>-axis or would we need to have
[Inaudible]?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Ah, let me come back to that. Let
me come back to that. The answer is, yes, it does go to zero. It
doesn't keep going up like this, but let me come back to that in a
second, and you'll see why. Okay.</p>

<p>So, it's all a balance of dark energy versus dark matter, or matter,
in general, but the dark matter predominates. And, at the moment, it is
true that the dark energy is--there's more of it. It exerts more, more
of an influence on the Universe; therefore, the Universe is not just
expanding, but also accelerating. We know that because these points are
above the line, not below the line. But this didn't always have to be
true. This balance changes with time.</p>

<p>So, currently, DE blows away the DM, but this can change. This
changes. In fact, this is almost certain to change with time. And the
reason is that the energy density of the dark energy and the matter
density of the dark matter behave differently as you change the size of
the Universe. It's all about the density here, so, matter density in
the past. You have the same amount of matter, but the Universe was
smaller.</p>

<p>Density is equal to mass over volume. So, if you have the same
<i>M</i>, but smaller <i>V</i>, this would have to have been bigger in
the past. And, in fact, it goes as the scale factor cubed, or 1 over
the scale factor cubed. Just because volume goes as a linear scale
cubed.</p>

<p>So, in the past, there was--the matter density was much greater than
it is right now, and therefore, the gravitational force trying to hold
the Universe together was greater than it is right now. But the
Cosmological Constant is constant, and what that means is that its
density is constant. And what that means is that, in the past, the dark
energy density was the same as it is now. That's just the way this
particular piece of Einstein's equations works. It's a constant.</p>

<p>Now, if you're about to ask the question, well, how does anything
behave that way, I'm going to give you the same answer. You know, they
have this wonderful thing in the British Parliament where they ask the
Prime Minister questions--obnoxious questions. And when they start
getting too many obnoxious questions in a row, what he'll do is, he'll
look at the camera and say, "I refer the Honorable Gentleman to the
answer I gave some moments ago." So, if you're going to ask what this
is and why it behaves that way, I will refer you to the answer I gave
to the Honorable Gentleman some moments ago; namely, I don't have a
clue. Something they don't generally say in political situations. All
right.</p>

<p>So, it's the same as now. But look at the implication of this. If
the matter density gets bigger and bigger and bigger as you go into the
past, and the dark energy density does not, then at some point in the
past, it must have been true that the matter density overwhelms the
dark energy. And then, at some point in the past, the dark energy and
the dark matter exert comparable effects on the Universe. And before
that, dark matter wins--that is to say, the Universe was
decelerating.</p>

<p>Now turn this around and go in chronological order. From the start
of the Universe until some moment, the Universe decelerated. It was
expanding, but it kept getting slower. Then, after some moment--and we
know that this moment was in our past, because after this moment, it
starts to accelerate. And we know that it's accelerating now. And so,
at some point in the past, there was a magic moment where everything
balanced, and then, it started to accelerate.</p>

<p>So, now, what does this look like on our graphs? What does this look
like on the graphs, here? Well, let's do the <i>a</i> versus <i>t</i>
thing, again. Here we are. Here's our reference empty Universe. And so,
recently, it's been accelerating. So, you know, if we look into the
past. And then, the prediction is, the extrapolation back to zero looks
kind of like this. And remember, if it looks like this, it's
decelerating. If it looks like this, it's accelerating. And so, the
dotted lines are extrapolations based on the idea that the dark energy
is the Cosmological Constant, and the dark matter behaves like matter
ought to behave.</p>

<p>And so, if you make those two assumptions, this is the curve you
get. And so, this is what you expect for Ω<sub>matter</sub> = .25;
Ω<sub>λ</sub> = .75 at present.</p>

<p>And so, you can predict, given these two quantities, and a
measurement of <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> equals about 70. This gives you an
age of the Universe. That is to say, the time from when <i>a</i> = 0 to
now--of the Universe, of something like 13 point; I think it's
actually, at the moment, 13.4 billion years, plus or minus, I don't
know .4, or something like that. Under the assumption that λ
equals--that the Cosmological Constant really is constant, that you've
got these kinds of proportions, and this kind of current Hubble
Constant. And then, you can just extrapolate all these lines in
whatever direction you like, and figure out where it crosses <i>a</i> =
0. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Can we see back to [Inaudible] see it as
deceleration or is it [Inaudible]?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Excellent question. The question
is, "Can we see far back in the past to see this deceleration?" The
answer is, just about yes, and I'll show you some data in a second.
Because this is a very strong prediction of the model--that is to say
that it should turn around. If you're imagining that there's something
wacky about supernovae, and that, as you go into the past, they look
fainter or something, as you were assuming on the problem set, then you
wouldn't necessarily predict that that would turn around and do the
other thing as you go further back in the past. So, this is a very
strong prediction of what ought to happen cosmologically, and so, of
course, people have been trying to test it. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> If the density of the Universe is changing, then
wouldn't it indicate that we're in some special time right now, given
the fact that the current density of the Universe is really close to
the critical density?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah. So, the question is about, if
the density is changing, why does the--what's so unusual about now,
that we're close to the critical density? The thing you have to
remember is, the critical density also changes with time. It's based
on--remember the critical density. It's 3<i>H</i><sup>2</sup> over
something or other. Well, <i>H</i> changes with time, because the
velocity is more or less the same, but the distances all change.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So, it's always been pretty close to the critical
density?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Well, what is true is that--the way
it works out, mathematically, what's true is that the sum of these two
quantities has always been close to 1. The ratio changes, but the sum
of these two--if the total Ω starts as 1, it stays at 1. But, it turns
out, it's the total Ω that you can--that is conserved. And we'll come
back to that point a little later.</p>

<p>Okay, let's see. Right. Okay. So, yes. Let's go there. Let's go for
the observational evidence. What would you expect it to be? Here we go.
This one, again. We keep going back and forth between these two plots.
That's what it's all about.</p>

<p>So, here's empty Universe, as always. And then, in this plot,
acceleration means a positive slope. So, if you're moving up in this
plot, the Universe has been accelerating--is accelerating at that
particular redshift, at that particular time in the past. So, you know,
the data we've looked at so far kind of look like points along a line
like this. That's the demonstration that the Universe is now
accelerating.</p>

<p>So, here's the prediction. And, you know, here's a magic moment
where, at that point, this slope is flat, and so, on this side, it's
decelerating, and on this side, it's accelerating. And the question is,
is it getting further away from--is it moving up compared to the empty
Universe, or is it moving down compared to the empty Universe? Because
the empty Universe neither accelerates nor decelerates. That's the
definition of an empty Universe. It doesn't have any mass. It doesn't
have any energy. The expansion rate is constant forever. So, if you're
going this way with respect to that line, or going this way with
respect to that line, you're accelerating, and if you're coming back,
going in the other direction, you're decelerating.</p>

<p>So, here's a closed Universe, right? This is a Big Crunch Universe,
which is going to re-collapse, because it's decelerating all the
time.</p>

<p>Now, interestingly, this turnaround point, where you turn around
between accelerating and decelerating, is not so far back into the
past. If you believe this set of parameters, the standard model, it's
at around 0.8. We can see stuff at 0.8. And you could hope to go and
see things even further out. Turns out, it's kind of--now, right at--if
you only go out to about 0.8, which is about as far out as they did for
the first time round, you're not going to see the turnaround, because,
you know, it's just more or less flat. You've got a few points out
there, and you're going to have a tough time telling the difference
between that and that at this point here. But if you go out just a
little bit further, you might really be able to see this turnaround
happening.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that turns out to be hard, observationally. It's hard
to see supernovae with redshifts greater than 1, for a number of
different reasons. First of all, they're faint. The further away they
are, the fainter they are. Second of all, they appear on top of
galaxies. Obviously, they live in galaxies. The further away you look,
the galaxies look smaller, and so, the supernova appear to be--the
further away you look, the more light from the galaxy the supernova is
superimposed on. And it becomes harder to separate the light from the
supernova and the light from the galaxy that it lives in.</p>

<p>And the third part is that the light is redshifted. Very redshifted.
Redshifted by a factor of two. So, supernovae give off most of their
light in optical light, which we can observe. But by the time they're
at a redshift of 1, all the wavelengths are doubled. And so, most of
the radiation is in the infrared, which is much harder to see from the
ground, because everything glows in the infrared. And, as I said
before, it's like looking in the daytime. The whole sky is glowing.
Your telescope is glowing. It's just really hard to make those kinds of
observations.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, to do--it's much easier to do this from
space. Now, faint is faint. It doesn't matter whether you're in orbit
or not. But the other two things are greatly aided by looking from
space.</p>

<p>Point two. You get much better images from space. And you may
recall, last time, I showed you a picture of a supernova, and from the
ground, you know, it was a little extra light on top of some galaxy.
And then, when you looked from space, the galaxy was clearly
delineated. And then, the supernova was a tiny point in the outskirts
of that galaxy. So, it makes it much, much easier to separate the
galaxy from the supernova.</p>

<p>And it is also true that the infrared background light is much
fainter, because you can keep stuff cold out there. The infrared
background light is much fainter and there's no atmospheric absorption.
The atmosphere actually absorbs a large fraction of the infrared light
that hits us. That's actually why the greenhouse effect works, because
light comes in as optical light and it makes it all the way through.
Then, it heats up the surface of the Earth. The Earth radiates heat,
which doesn't make it through the atmosphere and it gets trapped. So,
there's no atmospheric absorption out there, and so, you have a much
easier time doing this from space.</p>

<p>So, what they have been doing is, recently, people, and in
particular, a guy named Adam Riess, have been using the space
telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, to find high redshift
supernovae.</p>

<p>There is a flaw in the way the space telescope is designed from the
point of view of trying to do this experiment. And the flaw is that it
doesn't look at very much of the sky at once. It only looks at a small
field of view. So, you don't find many, because you're just not looking
at that big a part of the sky. And so, you only look at a tiny piece of
the sky at once. However, they have spent--because this is of some
clear importance, they have spent many, many, many hundreds of
observing hours with the space telescope trying to track down a few
supernovae at a redshift greater than 1. And they have now succeeded in
doing so. So, here's what the data look like.</p>

<p>This is from Adam's recent paper, 2004. I guess it's no longer quite
so recent. And this is the plot. Let me see if I can focus this. It's
actually the Xerox quality. We have a joke in astronomy that many
important objects turn out to be LSXTS, which stands for Low
Significant Xerox Transient Source. That means you've made a Xerox and
a little blip appears on your graph and somebody says, what's that
point in the upper right-hand corner? And you say, oh, that's the Xerox
machine.</p>

<p>All right. So, I apologize for that. But look what's happening. This
is redshift. This is the plot we've been looking at before, 0, .5, 1.0,
1.5, and 2. And this is the Delta (<i>m</i> – <i>M</i>) axis. So, 0 is
what you expect the empty Universe to have. And he has marked on here a
different set of lines from the set of lines I've been drawing. But,
nevertheless, you can see what's going on.</p>

<p>Here are--these are all supernovae--all the supernovae they know.
These kinds of fuzzy gray points are the ones they found with the space
telescope. The ones in here are the ground-based ones known at the
time. And what they've done is they've averaged them together in groups
of redshift, grouping by redshift. That's the bottom thing. So, each
one of these points is an average of many supernovae. This point is an
average of these two. And then, as you get down to lower redshifts
where they have lots and lots of them, the precision gets much
better.</p>

<p>But you can definitely see what's happening. Here, out to about, you
know, .5, .8, it's going up. And then, it does definitely seem like
it's going down. And so, there really is, now, some evidence for this
turnaround.</p>

<p>Now, it kind of all depends on these two points. I have a rule of
thumb. My rule of thumb is you can put your thumb over any one point,
because you never know what screw up might have happened in any one
measurement. So, I can't really do that on the top. But if I do this,
and I make that point go away, you could still kind of draw a line that
keeps going up. It would miss this point by a little, but not by a lot.
It's really this that does it. It's these last two individual
supernovae down there, which really make the case that the thing is
turning over and coming back down.</p>

<p>Now, you have to worry a little bit--and there's actually a good
reason to worry about the brightness of high redshift supernovae. And
let me give you one particular reason to worry, namely, gravitational
lensing. Remember gravitational lensing? You stick some mass in the
middle, between you and the object you're looking at. It focuses the
light. Gravitational lensing makes things look brighter. The further
away you look at something, the more likely it is that there's
something in between that will do the lensing.</p>

<p>So, first of all, point one: more distant objects, more likely to be
lensed. Point two: if you're out looking for very distant, very faint
objects, which are the ones you're going to see first?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The bright ones.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> The bright ones, yes. At the, sort
of, faint limit, you see abnormally bright things first. I can't even
spell that--abnormally bright things, preferentially. So, you could
imagine, if you're basing your entire cosmology on one or two high
redshift supernovae, you got to ask yourself the question: supposing
those happen to be lensed?</p>

<p>So, let me now go back to this plot. Here's the plot. So, if they're
lensed, then they're brighter--then they seem to be brighter than they
actually are. They're actually fainter than they look. That would have
the effect that this one actually ought to be up here, and this one
actually ought to be up here, if they were lensed by some amount. So,
if these things are lenses, then the true, correct position of these
points would be higher up in the graph than it actually is. So, this is
the effect of lensing.</p>

<p>Now, when it was only one of these points, people were very
concerned about this. Now that there's two, people are a lot less
concerned, because, you know, it would be pretty bad luck to have both
of the supernovae that you know about at high redshift turn out to be
lensed. If they had twenty, this whole problem would go away, because
there would be no possible way that you could be so unlucky--well, you
could calculate the probability that you would be so unlucky as to have
the first twenty high redshift supernovae you know happen to line up
right behind some massive object, and it would be some incredibly small
probability. So, each time you observe another one of these things out
there and it's low, you get around this lensing problem.</p>

<p>I should say this is only one of a number of problems. These things
are very hard to observe. They're very faint objects. But,
nevertheless, I think, at the moment, the evidence for this turnaround
is highly suggestive, but not yet wholly conclusive. All right.</p>

<p>But now, suppose you actually want to get higher accuracy than just
seeing the thing turnaround. Because, suppose dark energy isn't
constant. Suppose the Big Rip really is going to happen. Then, DE
density increases with time. This leads to the Big Rip, as we discussed
last time. And therefore, the dark energy density was less in the past
than in now. And therefore, the deceleration, the moment of balance
between deceleration and acceleration was more recent.</p>

<p>Because, as you go back in the past under this new scenario where
the density of dark energy is increasing with time, it's therefore
decreasing as you go into the past. So, as you go into the past, two
things happen – the density of matter gets bigger, and the density of
dark energy gets less. So, there's an additional effect that will make
that crossover happen earlier.</p>

<p>And so, to summarize on these, by now, almost boring and ubiquitous
plots, here. All right. So, here's the, kind of, standard cosmological
model, and if it's going to be a--oh, and then, this predicts in the
future that it's going to go something like, if it's a Big Rip, then
what happens is, it's doing this, and it's going to do that. Because
the dark matter takes over from the dark energy more recently in the
past. Because you've also lost oomph in your dark energy, but the dark
energy's getting bigger and bigger with time.</p>

<p>This, then, translates onto this plot. And here is what we expect,
and here's the kind of prediction into the future. Future of
observations. Further into the past in time. And what you would expect
is that this would sort of keel over earlier.</p>

<p>So, this is a Big Rip cosmology. Big Rip cosmology has the same--Big
Rip would have the same expansion rate now, the same acceleration now,
but more acceleration in the future than you'd expect, and more
deceleration in the past.</p>

<p>And so, it's important, not just to see this turnaround, but to
actually plot, in detail, where that line goes. Because, if it turns
out that your supernovae are kind of lined up like this, or they're
kind of lined up like this--you already know that there are a bunch of
them like this--or that they're kind of lined up like this, makes a
huge difference in how you understand the dark energy, and tells you
something new about the dark energy. In fact, it tells you the first
thing you know about the dark energy other than that it exists--namely,
that it would be getting bigger or less big, or maybe staying constant
as a function of time. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Well if the deceleration was earlier than expected
following the Big Bip cosmology, wouldn't we have seen it already since
we [Inaudible]?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> So, these three lines, at about,
you know, 0.8, are very, very close together. They don't diverge all
that much until a redshift--until the turnaround, at about a redshift
of .8 to 1. Now, in principle, you could go out and make a whole bunch
of--you know, measure 10,000 of these things at a redshift of .5, and
try and distinguish that way.</p>

<p>Okay. So, how are we going to figure this out? The space telescope,
kind of, finds these things one at a time. It's going to be awfully
tough to make this distinction. But let me introduce you to two
projects currently underway, the goal of which is to figure this out.
They do the exact two things that we've just been talking about. One is
designed to go deep-to-high redshift, and the other is designed to do
many, many, many, at intermediate redshift.</p>

<p>So, there is something called the--so, there's a space mission,
space telescope. This is called JDEM, stands for Joint Dark Energy
Mission. And the joint means joint between NASA and the Department of
Energy. Whoever named this stuff dark energy gets a little prize,
because now we get money from the Department of Energy to study it.
Let's see. And the idea--of which an example is something called Snap 1
Proposal. That's the supernova acceleration probe.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> This is part of the JDEM?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> This is an example of one mission
proposed to be JDEM. This is an example. And it's an example I'm
familiar with, because we have people here at Yale who are working on
it. And there are competitors. They haven't actually selected the thing
yet.</p>

<p>And what this is going to be is, it's a space telescope that differs
from the current space telescope in two major ways. One is, it has a
wide field of view, dozens of times bigger than the current space
telescope. So, it can do twenty--let me see if I can remember. It's
like twenty--it's over 100 times bigger field of view than the current
space telescope. So, the discovery rate of supernovae will be much,
much greater. And it's optimized for the infrared.</p>

<p>And so, its goal is to find many supernovae with redshift greater
than 1, perhaps out to a redshift of 2. That's its purpose in life. And
proposals are currently being evaluated for this. Launch time is
supposed to be–well, the optimists say 2013, but that means
congressional funding this year, which is actually unlikely. More
likely 2016 or 2017, and then, we'll know. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is optimization for infrared or are there any other
predicted, sort of, benefits of having [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh, it's very nice to look at the
infrared, because anything at high redshift shines in the infrared. And
so, if you're looking at high redshift galaxies, how galaxies evolve,
and so forth, this is useful, too. There's actually a big debate over
whether you totally set the thing up to do nothing but supernovae, or
whether you sort of generalize it and spend half your time doing other
things.</p>

<p>And there's one other project, at least, which I'll describe next
week, that these guys are interested in doing, but there's a real
tradeoff between making it a general purpose telescope like the Hubble,
or doing this one thing especially well. And that's, you know, the kind
of thing that's currently under discussion.</p>

<p>So, SNAP is one example of where people might go in the future.
Another is a ground-based project called the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope. This is otherwise known as LSST. LSST. The plan is this. And
this has a lot of other science besides this. It's going to do a full
survey of the sky every three days. So, it's going to--every three
nights, it marches across the entire sky, takes a really deep image of
the sky.</p>

<p>And so, the consequence of this for cosmology is that you find every
low and intermediate redshift supernova. That's tens to hundreds of
thousands--tens of--maybe 10,000 a year, approximately. So, you find
lots of these things. So, first of all, you build up incredible
statistics out to a redshift of about 1/2. So, huge statistics to
<i>Z</i> of about 1/2. That's kind of where its limit is going to kick
in. And you also can study the details of sub-classes of
supernovae.</p>

<p>So, this is important, because you know if you're fooling yourself,
because the distant supernovae are different, somehow, from the local
supernovae. They're fainter for some reason. But in the local sample,
only one in 100 is of the faint kind. If you've got 10,000, that means
you've got, you know, a sample of 100 of the weird subclass that's
causing you trouble. So, this will be hugely helpful, not only in
beating down the statistics so that you can tell the difference between
lines that are really quite close to each other, theoretical
predictions that are close to each other, but it also will test the
systematic problems that you might have different kinds of supernovae
and generally enhance your overall confidence that you know what you're
talking about.</p>

<p>Also, these kinds of sky surveys are of benefit for many, many other
fields of astronomy. The issue with this is the following statistic.
Thirty terabytes of data per night, right? That's 30,000 gig per night.
Thirty million megabytes every night.</p>

<p>And so, this is not something that us normal astronomers can handle,
and so, the recent news from the LSST project is, Google has joined the
project. And so, we're bringing in the--yeah, right. We're bringing in
the big boys for this. And I think this is kind of Google Universe,
right? Because it's a--you know, you take all--you do this for a few
years, and you've done 100 sky surveys. You can then add them all up
and get incredibly deep data. And so, I guess Google figured, you know,
if somebody's going to be piling up a catalog of the entire known
Universe, they'd better be a part of it. And it's fortunate for us,
because they're probably the only people in the world who can create a
database of data coming in at this rate.</p>

<p>And, I should say, keep in mind that you have to actually, not just
acquire this data, you have to actually look at it each night. Because
you've got to actually discover these supernovae in real time, because
they're going to be gone three weeks from now, or three months now. And
so, you not only have to pile up 30 terabytes of data every night,
you've got to actually look at it and find all the interesting objects.
So -</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible] can they do it for?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> The plan, currently, is to operate
for at least five and probably ten years. They have a site picked out.
They're going to put it down in Chile, actually, on the mountain where
our tiny telescope is. And so, we actually like this, because they'll
pay for some of the infrastructure costs down there--hopefully, for all
of the infrastructure costs. But negotiation's still in progress.</p>

<p>And they have a whole design planned for this. It's all ready to go,
but it's going to cost a fair amount of money to build. And what's even
more important: it's going to cost an enormous amount of money to run,
just on a night-to-night basis. So, actually, the construction costs of
the telescope are not the dominant cost. The dominant costs are
building the software and running the program. And it turns out, that's
harder to get some rich guy to give you a $100,000,000 for. And it's
ground-based, so it doesn't fall into the NASA category. And so, it
isn't clear where the money is going to come from. They actually have a
fair amount of private money already piled up. And, as I say, they have
detailed, elaborate plans for this thing. You can look at their
website. In fact, you will have to look at their website, because
that's going to be part of the problem set.</p>

<p>And so, these are two of the projects, which are currently being
designed and hopefully soon will be built, that are going to try and
push this a little further and try and find out more about the dark
energy than simply the fact that it exists.</p>

<p>Okay, let me put back up this piece of paper with details. Remember,
no sections on Monday. No sections on Monday.</p>
