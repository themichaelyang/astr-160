<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Welcome back to more of Astronomy
160. The syllabus, if you haven't got it yet, is on the classes server.
We have extra copies but I have to say I don't know where they are, and
in any case, everything that you need to know is on the classes server
and there's actually more than is on the printed syllabus there
anywhere.</p>

<p>Let me say a couple things; we're going to stick to the rule that
there should be no science majors taking this class. And from the looks
of the enrollment, there's going to be no problem for juniors and
seniors. I think we've got plenty of sections to accommodate everyone
in here, provided you're not a science major. But the way it's going to
work in terms of signing up for the class, I think, as I understand it,
is as follows: You need a section, sections are mandatory for this
course. So, you have to go through the online section sign up process.
That'll start on Monday but it'll only start for freshman and
sophomores on Monday. Juniors and seniors will be able to sign up for
the course and sign for sections on Tuesday, and so please do that.
Sections will start--sections are going to be on Mondays, so they
obviously won't start next week they'll start the following week. I
have no doubt looking around the room that we're going to be able to
accommodate juniors and seniors if they want to take the class.</p>

<p>All right, other things, yes, the first problem set is assigned as
of today. When I get back to my office I'll stick that on the classes
server as well, and you can pick it up from there. It's due one week
from today. The way I like to do this, I like to have problem sets due
at the start of class because it bugs me to look out and watch people
copying each other's problem sets. So, you have to hand it in at the
beginning of class otherwise it's late. On the classes server, there's
a whole little thing about lateness policy which you ought to read. And
also something--let me make a couple general remarks about problem
sets. The purpose of problem sets is different from the purpose of a
take-home test. This is not something where the major purpose is to
evaluate how much you know. The point of problem sets is to get you to
actually do those particular problems because that's how one learns
stuff in this kind of subject matter. It's kind of like doing the
reading; if you don't do it, you're just going to have trouble. And so,
the reason it's a substantial fraction of your grade is just to make
sure that you do it.</p>

<p>So, this has implications for working in groups. Working in groups
is strongly encouraged. Please do that. It's a very good thing, make
friends with the other people in the class, work together, talk to each
other, start early, and make use of each other's intelligence. However,
at the same time, we want to make sure that you actually do things. So,
we want the work you hand in to be your own. This sounds contradictory.
On the one hand, I'm tell you to work in groups; on the other hand, I'm
telling you, you have to hand in your own work. What does that mean?
So, as is written down on the classes server, the way we try and work
this is when you are actually writing down the thing you're going to
hand in, do that alone. So, if you work in a group, figure out what
you're doing, get everything all set up, then split up and write down
the answer, because the process of actually writing the thing down
yourself will make sure that you've actually understood what you were
doing. We'll check on this. We'll look for identical wording or
identical multiplication mistakes and so forth, and so we'll keep a
little bit of an eye on it. I do encourage you to work in groups.</p>

<p>There's other ways of getting help if you need it. The primary
source of help are the sections, but of course, those won't be meeting
this week so not before the first problem set is due. Office hours;
I'll be in Starbucks Monday from 9:30 to 11:00; please come and say
hello, and ask any questions you might have. The teaching fellows are
going to have office hours on Wednesdays; conveniently located the day
before the problem sets are due you'll notice. And let me strongly
recommend, don't send us email with questions about it. Send things
into the forum on the classes server. That way--and look first on the
forum to see if somebody has sent your questions. This works really
well. We'll keep an eye on that all the time. We'll be answering
it--not all the time, not probably after around 8:00 at night on
Wednesday. If you have a question at 2:00 in the morning the day before
something is due you're kind of on your own. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is that Monday 9:30 to 11:00 in the morning or the
evening?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Excellent question, thank you so
much. Morning, I'm afraid, sorry. Yeah, I'm not as young as I used to
be. Let me say, if you do want to meet at some ghastly hour of the
evening or something, send me email. We can find a time, same with the
teaching assistants. Send stuff into the classes server at all times,
we just don't guarantee to look at it after 8:00 the night before it's
due. Start the problem sets early, that way if you have a question you
can answer it. Not only that, if you even just look at the problem set,
your brain will work on it in your subconscious and you won't freak out
quite so much when you get past midnight the night before it's due.</p>

<p>Let's see, in general, I'm going to try and make it so that
everything you need to know to do a particular problem set has been
covered in class by the day the problem set is handed out. That would
be today for this one. In the very first week this week I'm not quite
going to make it and so there's one problem, it's noted on the problem
set, there's one problem that you'll need stuff that I'll talk about on
Tuesday. There are going to be a bunch of help sheets for various
topics that are going to also be linked to the classes server. By all
means, take a look at the problem set and start thinking about it as
soon as you can. Okay.</p>

<p>Let me remind you what we had started to talk about. The class is
organized into three fairly specific topics. The first of which is
extrasolar planets. Planets around stars other than the Sun.
Exoplanets, so-called. That's our topic. One of the things that I
pointed out last time is that, surprisingly enough, very--until ten
years ago none of these were known. And it's only a very recent
development that there's any actual evidence that these things exist.
So, one question you might ask is why are these things so hard to find?
The science fiction folks seem to have no trouble; they just sort of go
around in their spaceships and find these things all over the
place.</p>

<p>And to consider that question let me show you a picture. Here's a
picture of a star. This is the star Sirius. It's the brightest. It's a
blowup obviously of a photograph plus a little Photoshopped [computer
program to edit photos] arrow. That's not a celestial object
[laughter]. So, this is a blowup of a photograph of the star Sirius.
Sirius is the brightest star in the sky to the--easily visible with the
naked eye. In fact, as I say, the brightest star. It's one of the
closest stars. It's a little bit brighter than the Sun intrinsically,
but it's ten light years away or so.</p>

<p>And let me comment on a couple features of this picture. First of
all, you can see the star covers a fair amount of area on this blown up
picture, but that has nothing to do with the actual size or shape of
the star itself. It's not like it's a big round ball with spikes coming
off it. That's not what's happening. In fact, if you had perfect optics
and perfect vision, this star would be a point basically so small you
couldn't resolve it right in the middle here. That's the physical
extent of the star at this scale. It's something like this [pointing to
photo], and you wouldn't be able to see it at all.</p>

<p>The reason it's extended is for two reasons; first of all, the
atmosphere distorts--this was a ground-based picture, the atmosphere
distorts how you see the star, and in particular, it's like looking up
from the bottom of a swimming pool. There's distortion in the
atmosphere and it makes the stars seem to jump around. And so if you
take a long photographic exposure of something the star has been
jumping around during the exposure and it smears out the image. Plus
also, the optics of the telescope aren't perfect, and these spiky
things here are due to the optics of the telescope. This sort of--there
are all these spikes and that has to do with how one of the mirrors of
the telescope is held up. So, the combination of optics and atmosphere
sort of spreads out the light by a whole bunch. This is always the case
even when you're doing observations from space.</p>

<p>Now, the little arrow here is pointing at a little bump off in the
side, but you might not have thought anything more of than you did
about these spikes. But in fact, that's not a property of optics;
there's actually something there. That's an object in orbit around
Sirius. And you might think that this is the way you would go about
finding planets orbiting other stars. It would look kind of like this.
Here's a great big star; there's a planet. And if you watch this thing
over a course of many years, you actually see the position of this
point move around. It's because it's in orbit. It's in about a
forty-year orbit. Here's the thing. This isn't a planet. It's another
star. This is another star somewhat fainter than this [pointing to the
photo of Sirius]. A planet would be 10,000 times fainter than this
thing, but probably in about the same relative position to this.</p>

<p>Now, picture all this light, all this mess from this star, and try
to find something right here that's 10,000 times fainter than this.
That's the problem. The problem is that planets are relatively faint
things. That, in itself isn't catastrophic. We have big telescopes; we
can see pretty faint things. It's just they are faint things that are
really near to things that are bright, and so basically, the problem
with finding planets around other stars is the same as trying to find
stars in the sky during the daytime. Why can't you see the stars during
the daytime? Because the background of the sky is much, much brighter
than the stars are. Similarly, if you had a little planet here you
wouldn't be able to distinguish it from the atmospheric distortions and
the optical distortions caused by the telescope that takes this
picture. So, the problem is you've got stuff that's faint near things
that are bright, and the bright things have all kinds of distortions on
them anyway, and so you wouldn't be able to figure out what actually is
a planet.</p>

<p>So, just to summarize this, the problem is not that the planets are
too faint, although they are quite faint. The problem is that the
planets are too close to the star. That prompts--we've got to quantify
this statement I think and so the question arises, "Well how close is
it?" That leads into a discussion, which we already started last time,
of planetary orbits. If you want to answer that question in any
quantitative sort of way. You will recall that in the last class I
wrote down an important equation of--regarding planetary orbits, that
looks like this: <i>a<sup>3</sup></i> = <i>P<sup>2</sup>M</i>, where
this [<i>M</i>] is the mass of the objects in orbit around each other
in units of solar masses. This [P<sup>2</sup>] is the orbital period in
units of years. And this [a<sup>3</sup>] is--orbits you will recall are
ellipses, and this is the so-called semi-major axis of the ellipse in
units called Astronomical Units, which is the distance from the Earth
to the Sun. Or the semi-major axis of the Earth-Sun orbit, more
properly. So, that's in a particular set of units.</p>

<p>Before going on, let me make a couple general remarks about
equations. First thing to say about equations is there's this idea that
equations, mathematics, is some terribly different language, not at
all. This is an English sentence. The sentence reads A cubed is equal
to <i>P</i> squared times <i>M</i>, period. If you wrote this down in a
textbook you'd actually see they put the period in there. It's got a
verb, is equal to, it's got a subject, it's got an object. All this is
is a different way of writing stuff down. So, it's not a different
language; it's just a different writing system, that's all. So, don't
freak out, that's the first thing. It's just ordinary English. The
second thing to say is that this is a physics equation and not a math
equation, and that's actually a subtler point. You will recall back in
eighth-grade algebra when they started writing down X is equal to
whatever X was equal to. And they said, you know, the amazingly cool
thing about algebra is that X could be anything. That's why it's so
powerful, and so you can solve whole classes of problems all at once
just by letting X equal something unknown.</p>

<p>That's math; physics--it isn't true. It is not the case that this
equation is true regardless of what <i>a</i> is, or regardless of what
<i>P</i> is. This is only true for very specific meanings of those
quantities. And the amazing thing about the Universe is it turns out
that math equations apply in very specific physical situations. This
didn't have to be true. Either that you could express physical things
in mathematical equations, and that math and physics would have
anything to do with each other. And it is different to have a physics
equation than to have a math equation because it has to be so specific.
If you substitute something that isn't the semi-major axis in for
<i>a</i>, then that equation isn't true anymore. It seems kind of
obvious, I know, but worth keeping in mind.</p>

<p>The other thing is that physics equations tend to have units
associated with them. Not always, but most of the time. And so that's
why it's so important to say, well, this is true not only if
<i>M</i>&nbsp;stands for mass but also if mass is expressed in a
particular set of units, in this case solar masses. You'll recall from
last time that this is actually a specific version of a slightly more
general equation which looks like this: <i>a<sup>3</sup></i> =
<i>P<sup>2</sup>GM</i>/4π<i><sup>2</sup></i>, where G is a constant
that depends on what units you're using. And last time I derived this
equation from that. But another way of saying it is if you choose your
units to be solar masses, years, and astronomical units; then G is
equal to 4π<sup>2</sup> and so it cancels out. That's another way of
thinking about why this specific version of the equation works out.</p>

<p>All right. So, once you've got your physics equation, what are you
supposed to do with it? Well, the first thing you should do is take a
careful look at it and figure out what kinds of problems you can solve.
This, again, is fairly straight-forward, obvious stuff. If you've got
<i>a<sup>3</sup></i> = <i>P<sup>2</sup>M</i>, there are obviously three
different problems you can solve. If you know <i>a</i> and <i>M</i> you
can compute <i>P</i>, right? If you know <i>a</i> and <i>P</i> you can
compute <i>M</i>. And if you know <i>P</i> and <i>M</i> you can compute
<i>a</i>. So, you know two of these things, you find out the third.
This problem--an example of this problem we did last time. We had--we
solved for the orbital period of Jupiter by knowing how far away from
the Sun it is and what the mass of the Sun is. So, like Jupiter last
time.</p>

<p>So, let's do another one of these examples just quickly here. What
is the mass of the Sun? So, that's obviously this version of the
problem [if you know <i>a</i> and <i>M</i> you can compute <i>P</i>].
And so, what we're going to do is we're going to take <i>a</i>&nbsp;and
<i>P</i> from the Earth's orbit. Use Earth's orbit to determine the
mass of the Sun. And this is, in fact, how one goes about determining
the mass of the Sun. So, let's use this in the units we have, <i>a</i>
= 1&nbsp;Astronomical Unit for the Earth. <i>P</i> is equal to 1 year
for the Sun. 1<sup>3</sup> = 1<sup>2</sup> x <i>M</i>. So, <i>M</i> = 1
in units of solar masses. That's not especially surprising, right? Not
particularly illuminating, right? That the mass of the Sun comes out to
be one in units of solar masses.</p>

<p>If we use a different set of units this is a more interesting
calculation. So, let's use a more standard set of units, this so called
<i>mks</i> units, this is meters, kilograms for mass, and seconds for
time. All right, so now, turns out an Astronomical Unit is expressed in
meters is 150&nbsp;billion meters, approximately. It looks something
like this [150,000,000,000]. And what's a year expressed in seconds?
Well, let's see a year is 365.24 days, a day is 24 hours, an hour is 60
minutes, and a minute is 60 seconds, so that's a year expressed in
seconds.</p>

<p>And at this point we better pause and get our large numbers
straight. You are all probably familiar I imagine with scientific
notation. This becomes very important, otherwise the numbers, as you
can clearly see, get completely out of hand. And because it's so
important I'm going to tire you by writing down some facts about
scientific notation. There's a help sheet on this if you have any
trouble but recall how this works. You're supposed to express numbers
as in the following form: N times 10<sup>m</sup>, this [N] is a decimal
with one digit out in front of the dot. This [m] is supposed to be an
integer, a whole number either positive or negative. And the reason
that this is easy to deal with is because of one of the great
limitations of the human brain. We only deal well with really small
numbers, basically one-digit numbers. If I take a few coins here and I
sort of throw them up you immediately know that there are four of them,
you don't have to count one, two, three, four to satisfy yourself that
there are four coins on this table because we have a concept of
fourness, all of us in our minds, and it's clear that this pattern
satisfies that concept.</p>

<p>If I threw two coins or six coins, or seven coins you'll probably be
okay. If I threw thirteen, you'd start to have real trouble. If there
were 271 of them, there's no way you could guess just by looking at
them how many there were. You'd have to count them one by one. So, the
human brain really only deals well with one-digit numbers and you can
tell this because of the names we give to numbers. When you start
getting big numbers we call them millions or billions, or trillions and
they all sound alike, that's because we can't tell the difference
between a million and a trillion, it's just big. So, anytime you get up
into big numbers we start to completely lose our grip on what these
numbers mean, and you have to have elaborate metaphors; a trillion is a
million millions. And if you fill up the Moon with ping-pong balls
there are--I don't know. You have to do that kind of mental exercise to
get a grip on it. The nice thing about scientific notation is that it
turns big numbers into small numbers, right? N is a number between one
and nine, m is an integer, it's one of those numbers four, five, six
that we can get our minds wrapped around. Recall what this means,
right, 10<sup>m</sup> is 1 with m zeros after it. So, that's the point
of scientific notation, it's to take big numbers and allow us to deal
with them.</p>

<p>I think this is a really valuable thing and I kind of wish that
budget discussions in the political context would take place in
scientific notation because people are always making mischief from the
fact that all big numbers sound alike. You have congress critters
saying things like, "oh terrible disaster," there's a million dollars
of waste in the Pentagon budget. The Pentagon budget is $500 billion
dollars. One million dollars of waste--that's me dropping a nickel
behind the couch on my budget. So that's--nobody would accuse me of
being wastefulness if I didn't move the couch and get that nickel out,
all right. It's because a million sounds big, and so does 500 billion.
We have no real sense of how big these things are relative to each
other. But we do have a sense of the difference between 6 and 11, which
is the difference in scientific notation between one million dollars
and $100&nbsp;billion dollars, so that's how this works. So, arithmetic
rules. Again, there's a help sheet on this if you're rusty.</p>

<p>If you have N times 10<sup>m</sup> and you multiply it by another
scientific notation number, A&nbsp;times 10<sup>B</sup>, that is equal
to A times N (times 10 to the n+m). And the other nice thing about
scientific notation is it turns multiplication into addition because
the exponents add: A times N to--times 10<sup>m</sup> plus B. [N x
10<sup>m</sup> x A x 10<sup>B</sup> = A x N 10<sup>m+B</sup>].
Similarly, if you take N times 10<sup>m</sup> and raise it to the K,
that's N<sup>k</sup> times 10 to the m times K, so it turns
exponentiation into multiplication. So, the nice thing about dealing
with exponents is it makes it one kind of arithmetic easier.</p>

<p>So, a specific example of this might be N times 10<sup>m</sup>, the
square root of that which is raising something to the ½ power. This is
equal to N<sup>1/2</sup> times 10<sup>m/2</sup>. That works if <i>m</i>
is an even number but if <i>m</i> is an odd number you get a crazy
exponent. This really has to be an integer over here. So, what do you
do then? You say N times 10<sup>m</sup> to the ½ is equal to 10 times N
times N<sup>m-1</sup> to the ½ power. So, I've just moved a 10 from
here over to here, and then that is equal to 10 N to the ½ times
10<sup>(m-1)/2</sup>. And that's how you recover when you take a square
root or something like that. That's how you recover an integer on this
side. We'll have lots of practice in this kind of thing.</p>

<p>So, going back to the problem. 1 AU is equal to 1.5 times
10<sup>11</sup> meters; 1 year is equal to 2.4 times 10<sup>1</sup>.
That's 24 times 6 times 10<sup>1</sup> times, 6&nbsp;times
10<sup>1</sup>, times 3.6524 times 10<sup>2</sup> seconds. All right,
so let's do that one, two, three, four, five--2.4 times 6 times, 6
times 3.6 times 10<sup>5</sup> to the 5; 2.5&nbsp;times 6 is around 15,
15 times 6 is around 90, 90 is a little less than 100, 3.6 a little
more than 6. Those two things multiplied together is around 300. And
300 times 10<sup>5</sup> is equal to 3&nbsp;times 10<sup>7</sup>. So,
there are around 3 times 10<sup>7</sup> seconds in 1&nbsp;year. That's
a good number to remember.</p>

<p>In <i>mks</i> units, G is this magical constant, is something like
7&nbsp;times 10<sup>-11</sup>. That's an approximation. It's actually
6.6 something, something, something times 10<sup>-11</sup>, but we'll
call it 7. So, now we're in a position to calculate what the solar mass
is in kilograms. So remember <i>a<sup>3</sup></i> equal to <i>GMP</i>
squared over 4π<sup>2</sup>. So, let's see, 1.5 times 10<sup>11</sup>;
that's an astronomical unit cubed. <i>P</i> squared, 3 times
10<sup>7</sup>; that's 1 year squared; 7&nbsp;times 10<sup>-11</sup>
that's <i>G</i> over <i>M</i> over 4π<sup>2</sup>. I'm going to do the
arithmetic really fast. I would like you to learn how to do this
yourself rather than relying on calculators so this is an example. Let
me blaze through this at warp speed; then we'll stop and consider
what's happened.</p>

<p>All right. On the right-hand side, 3<sup>2</sup> is--that's
3<sup>2</sup> times 10<sup>7</sup> times 2 is 14, times 7&nbsp;times
10<sup>-11</sup>. <i>M</i> over 4 times π, times π. 3<sup>2</sup> is
10. 10 times 10<sup>14</sup> is 10<sup>15</sup>. And so on the top
we've got 10<sup>15</sup> times 7, times 10<sup>-11</sup>. 15 minus 11
is 4 so that's 7 times 10<sup>4</sup> on top. π times π is 10 that's
40. 4 times 10 to the 1 on the bottom, 7 divided by 4 is 2, and so
that's 2 times 10<sup>3</sup> times m. Good, left-hand side, all right
1.5 times, 1.5 times, 1.5, that's 1.5<sup>3</sup> times
10<sup>33</sup>, why 33? That's 11 times 3. 1.5 times 1.5 that's a
little bit more than 2. If you multiply something that's a little bit
more than 2 by something that's a little bit less than 2 that's 4, and
so this is 4 times 10<sup>33</sup>. Now we want <i>m</i>, right? So
we've got to divide both sides by 2 times 10<sup>3</sup>; m is equal to
4 halves times 10<sup>33</sup> over 10<sup>3</sup>. That's
10<sup>-33</sup> minus 3. That's 2 times 10<sup>30</sup> kilograms, got
to put the units in. Okay, how we doing? Questions, comments, abuse.
Yes sir?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How accurate is that number?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> How accurate is that number? It's
accurate to about one digit, which is why I only wrote down one digit
of accuracy out front. This is a pro--excellent question thank you very
much. This is appropriate because remember I'm using 7 times 10 minus
11 for <i>G</i>, where it's actually 6.6. So, I'm already about 10% off
from there. I did my little calculation to come up with one year equals
3 times 10<sup>7</sup> seconds. That's about accurate to one digit or
so. And so the whole thing is done to one digit accuracy. If you're
dealing with one digit accuracy, it is true that 7 divided by 4 is 2.
It really is true, because if that wasn't true, then you would have to
have more digits on your unit for <i>G</i> or something like that. In
particular, let me make an official rule for this course. Three equals
π, equals the square root of 10, all right. That will solve an enormous
amount of arithmetic problems and it will not get you into any serious
trouble. So, we don't have to worry about the .14159 and however many
more digits you all memorized it to. And when you multiply it together
you get ten. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Are you expecting this kind of calculation for
problem sets?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yes. The question was, "Am I
expecting this kind of calculation for problem sets?" The answer is
"yes." Here's the rule about calculators. Let me put it this way: You
can only use calculators if I can't tell that you've done it. So, that
means you can check your work to make sure you've it right or
something. But if you start coming up with numbers like 7.1516397,
that's eight digits of accuracy and I'm pretty sure you haven't worked
it out yourself. So important, no calculators on the tests, okay? So,
get some practice doing this kind of thing. And this will--this I
promise you will be useful to you in everyday life because this is how
you catch the politicians doing screwy things with big numbers. You do
it in your head in scientific notation and you figure out whether the
answer is meaningful or not.</p>

<p>This whole business of significant digits, I think, is badly
distorted; by the way, it's taught in high school. In high school you,
and also I should say in laboratory courses sometimes at the college
level, you often get situations where people say--give you a whole
sheet of rules on how to figure out how many significant digits you
have. This is nonsense. All you have to do is behave like a human
being. We say to each other, I'll meet you in the dining hall in ten
minutes. That doesn't mean--that means something different from I'll
meet you in the dining hall in eleven minutes and twenty-six seconds.
Even if the person happens to show up in the dining hall in exactly
eleven minutes and twenty-six seconds. Ten minutes means I'll meet you
there in ten minutes, we all know what that means. I'll meet you there
in eleven minutes and twenty-six seconds means you're a character in a
bad spy novel who's just synchronized his watch. So, this shows up in
science fiction too.</p>

<p>I don't know how many of you are Star Trek fans, I certainly am
[laughter]. And in all the different Star Trek movies [inaudible
comment]--thank you. In all the different--a friend [referring to
person who made comment]. In all the different Star Trek movies there's
always a second in command who isn't a human being, right? A Vulcan or
an android or some damn thing or another. And to emphasize the
non-humanness of these characters, what they do is they make them use
too many significant digits. And so that makes them inhuman and so the
captain will say, "When are we landing on omicron <i>M</i>?" The second
in command will say, "Well, we should assume standard orbit in 2.6395
minutes," emphasizing somehow superior brain power or something. But
it's nonsense because it takes the guy ten seconds to say that
sentence, so what is this time calculated to a 100th of a second? Does
it start from when he begins the sentence? From when he ends the
sentence? What's the other end of that time interval? Can you say you
assume standard orbit to the 100th of a second? What does that even
mean? When you start beaming down? When you end beaming down? Also,
keep in mind it takes more than a 100th of second for the sound to
travel from his lips to the captain's ears, so the whole thing is just
nonsense. And so, you don't need any special rules, just behave like a
human being; don't behave like an android. So, no androids. And that's
the only rule I'm going to give you [laughter]. These two are the only
rules I'm going to give you about significant digits, just do the right
thing, okay.</p>

<p>All right, okay so this is all lovely but we haven't actually
started to answer the question we started the class with. Let me remind
you where we began this disquisition on numbers. The question was
supposed to be how far away from stars are planets? So, we haven't
answered the question, when the question was, "How close are planets to
stars?" This notation will confuse the people who didn't make it to
class today; that's probably just as well too.</p>

<p>All right, how close to planets--are planets to stars? Now, we have
a problem because closeness--we usually think of this as being measured
with distances. And distances are a serious problem in astronomy.
Supposing you--Distance, by the way, is more or less the same thing as
size, right? Size is the distance from one side of something to another
side of something. So, size and distance are the same. So, supposing
you ask the question, "How big is the Moon?" What is the size of the
Moon? What is the distance from one side of the Moon to the other? You
go out one night and you look up at the Moon and you do this [holding
fingers apart], one on each side of the Moon. You say, well, it's about
an inch and a half. Now, obviously that's meaningless, because if you
had done it here, it would have been about a half inch. And we all know
that isn't--that somehow is not the right answer. If you look at the
screen over here, for example, and you hold out your hands about eight
inches from your--close one eye, hold out--you can try this, hold out
your hands about here, you'll find that that screen--the lit part of
the screen is about four or five inches across. But if you go closer to
your eye, it's only about an inch across. If you're at arm's length
it's maybe six, eight inches where I'm standing here. And if you try it
at the back of the class, you'll get a different answer from what I
just got.</p>

<p>So, distance is a problematical thing. And so--But on the other
hand, obviously, the size of the screen hasn't changed depending on
where my arms were or whether I'm standing at the back of the room or
the front of the room. So, something has to be measurable there, but it
isn't distance. What it is, is angle. What you can measure in astronomy
are angles. So, here's what you really want to know. Here's a star;
here's a planet going around the star, and here is you [draws diagram
on overhead]. This is the international symbol for an observer; it's
supposed to be a little stylized eyeball. So, this observer is looking
at this star-planet system. And looks at the star and looks at the
planet. And what you can measure is the angle, which I'm going to call
<i>α</i> here. And if you simulate the angle by putting your hands up
close to your eye, you'll get a small distance; if you do it further
away you'll get a bigger distance. But what you are measuring is the
angle. What you would like is a way of being able to convert from that
angle into a distance.</p>

<p>And now, the ugly specter of trigonometry rears its head. Because
that's what trigonometry is. It's a way of turning angles into
distances and vice versa. And you may remember constructions that look
vaguely like this; let's put some labels on it. Here's distance 1,
here's distance 2, here's distance 3. And this is the definition of
sine, the sine of <i>α</i> is equal to the opposite over the
hypotenuse, so that's D<sub>2</sub> over D<sub>3</sub>. And now--so
that's how you do it. Now, I promised you on Tuesday that the sine was
going to cancel out, and so it is. Here's how. If you use small angles
it turns out that the sine of <i>α</i> is equal to <i>α</i>, if
<i>α</i> is expressed in radians, which is a particular kind of measure
of angles. And so for small angles, first of all, the hypotenuse and
the longer side are the same length more or less. So, you've got a
situation like this where D<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;over D<sub>1</sub> is
equal to <i>α</i>. That is--let's circle that one in red; it's going to
be important. That's called the small angle formula. And once again,
you have to be careful of the units. And once again, there's two sets
of units in which you might possibly use this.</p>

<p>So D<sub>2</sub> over D<sub>1</sub> is equal to α. If D<sub>2</sub>
and D<sub>1</sub> are in the same units, then α has to be radians. A
radian--there are 2π radians in a circle. You'll recall there are 360
degrees in a circle that's how you convert from degrees to radian. But
there's a better set of units. It turns out also that if you do this,
use this equation D<sub>2</sub>,/D<sub>1</sub>, α, and D<sub>2</sub> is
measured in Astronomical Units, remember those? That's the Earth-Sun
distance. And D<sub>1</sub> is measured in parsecs, which is equal to 3
times 10<sup>16</sup> meters; that's about three light years, for those
of you counting at home. And α is in arc seconds. Then it also works
out. Let me tell--an arc second, let's see, 60 arc seconds is equal to
an arc minute. Just so you know how these units work; 60 arc minutes is
equal to 1 degree. So, that's a really small angle. So, it turns out
this set of units is particularly useful for these kinds of planet
calculations, because distances from planets to stars tend to be a few
astronomical units. Distances from us to the nearest star. The nearest
star, aside from the Sun, turns out to be about 1&nbsp;parsec away. So,
distances to stars are some number of parsecs. And so, you'll get
answers that are a few arc seconds, and this is yet another way of
turning big numbers into small numbers. You've used the right set of
units so that everything's approximately one. Another way of
compensating for the weakness of the human brain.</p>

<p>Okay, so now we can solve a problem. We can actually solve
numerically the question of how far away from a star is our planet? So,
here's an example. Here's a problem of the kinds that might show up on
a problem set. I told you that that object orbiting Sirius has about a
forty-year period. So, let's take a planet with a forty-year period;
that's kind of between Saturn and Uranus in our own Solar System.
Around a star 3&nbsp;parsecs away; <i>pc</i> means parsecs, whatever
they may tell you in the humanities classes. Around a star
3&nbsp;parsecs away, what is the angular separation? Angular
separation, because that's what we can actually measure. We can't
measure the distance but we can measure the angle.</p>

<p>Okay, so this is a hard problem, why is it hard? It's hard for two
different reasons. First of all, well, you guys know how to solve
problems like this. You all went to high school. What you do is you
say, okay what do I know? I have <i>P</i> = 40, I have <i>D</i> = 3, I
want α, so I look for an equation with <i>D</i>, <i>P</i>, <i>D</i> and
α in it. I shove these two things into--you substitute them in for
<i>P</i> and <i>D</i>, and then I calculate α. And you don't have to
actually know anything about anything in order to do that; you just
have to have a good set of notes. And you go through all the different
equations until you find the equation that contains all the variables
you have, and the one that you're asked for. And then you can just plug
it in, you don't have to know anything about anything. This won't work,
right? Because if you go through the lecture notes thus far, you will
not find an equation with <i>P</i> and <i>D</i> and α in it because
it's two different equations that you have to put together. And that
requires you to actually know what you're doing. And that of course is
much harder. So, plug and chug won't work. Chug fails because there's
no one equation.</p>

<p>This is a hard problem for another reason, which is that I haven't
told you something important. If you try and go through and solve this
you will discover that you don't have all the information you need, and
in particular, you need to know the total mass of the system, the mass
of the star. Most of the mass is in the mass of the star. So, there's
missing information. That's one way to make a problem hard, the other
way to make a--if I don't tell you everything you need to know, it's a
somewhat harder problem. The other way to make a problem hard--this is
a classic, be warned--I will do this at some point, is to give you one
extra piece of information that you don't need. This screws students up
totally because you go looking for the equation that uses the extra
piece of information, and there is no such an equation and you don't
need it, then you're cast into doubt. I must need this somehow or he
wouldn't have given it to me. Nonsense. In real life it is not the case
that all problems come to you with all the information you need and
only the information that you need. That's not how things work in real
life. And it shouldn't be how things work in preparation for real life,
which is I guess what classes sort of ought to be. So, missing
information, too much information, sometimes although not in this case;
I could have told you the temperature of the star, for example. I'll do
that. The temperature of Sirius is 10,000 degrees, surface temperature.
So, now I've given you both; I've left out information and told you too
much.</p>

<p>All right, so what is the mental process that you need to go through
in solving a problem which has these kinds of difficulties associated
with it? Okay. So, how to think about such problems? The first thing to
notice is what you would do in the ordinary plug and chug. What have
you got, what do you need? You have a value for the orbital period, you
have a value for the distance, and what you want is an angle. Okay.
Now, so this doesn't lead you to where you want to go. The next thing
you've got to do is make an assumption. This is a star; all stars are
more or less the same. So, let us imagine that this star has a mass
more or less similar to that of the Sun. So, the <i>M</i> is
approximately equal to a solar mass. How far wrong could you go? In
fact, you go wrong by about a factor of two, but at a certain point
you're going to take the cube root of two, and so it actually isn't so
bad. So suppose <i>M</i> is equal to the mass of the Sun, most stars
are approximately. Ah ha, now we're getting somewhere, because now we
have <i>M</i> and <i>P</i>. And if you have put that equation--Kepler's
Third Law--and interpreted it deeply into your brain, and it has become
part of your heart and soul and very being, you will immediately
realize that if you have <i>M</i> and <i>P</i>, of course you can
calculate <i>a</i>. In fact, you probably realized this first before
you make the assumption in step two, because that's why you're
interested in the mass, because you realize that if you happened to
have <i>M</i>, you would be able to determine <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>Next thing you have to do is, is interpret what this <i>a</i> is;
<i>a</i> is the semi-major axis of the orbit of the planet around the
star. That's something very close to--very similar to--the distance
between the star and the planet is <i>a</i>. So, <i>a</i> in this
equation is the same as D<sub>2</sub> in the other equation, all right.
So, <i>a</i> is D<sub>2</sub> and the distance you have up there is the
distance from us to that whole system, that's D<sub>1</sub>. And now,
you can compute α, right? That's the thought process. And you may have
to go--sort of worry a little bit around here before you have the "ah
ha" moment of how to get the problem. This is the moment when you've
solved the problem. The key to solving this is to have an instinctive
reaction to knowing that you've got a period; namely, if I had a mass I
could figure out the semi-major axis. Or if I had the semi-major axis,
I could figure out the mass. And that has to click. And the way that
clicks is to have this equation really--I was joking before--but really
become instinctive in a certain way, and there won't be many equations
in this class. But it will really help you to assimilate them in that
kind of depth.</p>

<p>All right, so now in the few minutes remaining, let me actually
solve this problem numerically. <i>P</i> is equal to 40 years, <i>D</i>
is equal to 3 parsecs. Here's something not to do: 40 times 3 times
10<sup>7</sup>, because that'll give you the answer in seconds. No
don't do that, because both of the equations would rather have things
in Astronomical Units and years and things like that. So
<i>a<sup>3</sup></i> equals <i>P<sup>2</sup>M</i>, <i>M</i> is 1 by
assumption, <i>P</i>&nbsp;is 40 so this is 1,600, that's 40<sup>2</sup>
on this side, <i>a<sup>3</sup></i> that's 1.6 times 10 to the 3. Now,
we're going to take the cube root of both sides, that's the cube root
of 1.6 times, the cube root of 1,000. 3 times a third is equal to 1,
conveniently enough. The cube root of 1.6, I don't know that's 1.2 or
something but call it 1. So, that's 10, and so it's 10 Astronomical
Units. Remember we're doing this in solar masses, years, Astronomical
Units. 10 Astronomical Units, that's how far away it is. Now, we can do
this [D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>1</sub>] where this is in Astronomical Units,
and this down here is in parsecs, and 10 divided by 3 is 3. So, the
answer is <i>a</i> is equal to 3 arc seconds.</p>

<p>Now, this is an important result because the--let me go back to this
picture. The angular scale over which light is kind of thrown around by
the atmosphere and by the optics of the kinds of telescopes we can
build is some number of arc seconds. Good ground-based observations,
maybe half the light is inside 1 arc second; the rest of the light is
scattered all the way out to maybe 10 arc seconds. From space it's a
little bit better. But, light from observations of stars is scattered
over angular sizes of arc seconds. So, you are guaranteed that there's
going to be a bunch of light from the star right on top of where you're
looking for your planet. And in fact, it's going to get worse, because
one of the things about this equation is D<sub>1</sub>; the distance to
the star.</p>

<p>We did this for Sirius. Sirius is one of the closest stars; it's 3
parsecs away. Most--the center of the galaxy is 8,000 parsecs away. So,
if you take a typical star in our galaxy this number isn't going to be
3; it's going to be 8,000. And this number isn't going to be 3, it's
going to something like 1/1000th of an arc second. And the space
telescope scatters light over tenths of arc seconds, so you have
factors of 100 buried inside the light coming from that star. So,
that's why you don't care about more than one digit. In fact, you
probably don't even care about anything other than the exponents of
this answer because why are you doing this problem? You're doing this
problem to figure out whether it's plausible to think that you might be
able to see a planet as a separate dot, separate from the star. And the
fact that your answer comes out in arc seconds or fractions of an arc
second tells you everything you need to know. You don't need anymore
decimal places to realize that the idea of looking up and seeing a
planet is going to fail. So, that's not the way that we're going to
find planets. So, we have to come up with different scheme and that's
what we're going to talk about on Tuesday. Thanks.</p>
