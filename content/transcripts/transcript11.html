<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> We were talking about relativity.
And where we ended up last time--we were talking about special
relativity and all the weird things that happen to space and time. And
the question arose, you know, what prompted Einstein to think these
thoughts? And we talked a little bit about the fact that the speed of
light is always the same no matter what the velocity of the person
observing it and how that--then, if you take that literally, it tells
you that space and time are weird, and are not constant and absolute
the way you might think they are in a Newtonian sense, but vary
according to the velocity of the observer and in these various ways
having to do with that parameter gamma.</p>

<p>And so, Einstein's great stroke of genius was not to try and fix up
these little problems with the experiment in some, sort of, patchwork
kind of way, or to try and invoke a minor change in the laws of nature,
but to recognize that this was a very big deal, and that would involve
changing fundamentally how we think space and time work.</p>

<p>So, this is a very famous fable of science, you know. This is the
thing where Einstein is a young man, and he's sort of a rebel. And he
refuses to take his exam and he pisses off his professors. And the
consequence is he doesn't get a good job. And he gets this job at the
patent office right, in Bern, Switzerland, where he labors away in
obscurity. And then, suddenly, in a blaze of glory in 1905, he
publishes three papers, one of which is about relativity, one of which
is the start of quantum mechanics, and the other of which proves that
atoms exist. And so, these are three of the greatest papers of all
time, published in a single year, by some clown who's a clerk in a
patent office. All right. Very big deal. This happened in 1905, two
years ago it was the hundredth anniversary of this. This was declared
Einstein Year, and all sorts of fuss was made about it.</p>

<p>So, there are various morals that can be drawn from this. And I'm
going to draw several of them in what you might call increasing order
of sophistication. So, the low sophistication moral, moral number one,
here, is, you know, about the genius in obscurity. A genius in
obscurity can revolutionize science.</p>

<p>This is a very dangerous way to approach the Einstein story. Because
it--you know, it's really easy to convince yourself that you are a
genius in obscurity. Many people have convinced themselves that they
are geniuses in obscurity. I know about this, because they send me
email. And they explain to me in their email that they send me--and
this happens to, you know, any scientist, particularly someone working
in astrophysics or fundamental physics of some kind--they explain to me
why Einstein was wrong. And indeed, why all science known to date is
wrong, and they are right. And then, they say, you know, nobody
believed Einstein either--as if that was somehow meant to make you
believe them. They tend to write these things all in capital letters.
There's a kind of pathology. When they used to write--when they used to
do it on pencil and paper, they would write in such a way that
you--they covered every inch of the paper. And, you know, they'd write
something, then they'd write around the margins, back to the top.
There's some psychological thing--I don't know what it is. But the
legend of Einstein prompts a whole bunch of people to think that they
too might be patent clerks. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How do people find you?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh, well, look. You can look up the
astronomy department website of Harvard, Yale and Princeton, and you'll
find a whole bunch of people, I suppose. I also have published papers
on black holes, and things that made their way into the media. I've
actually had a fall-off on this, because I haven't been, you know,
quoted opining about black holes in <i>The New York Times</i> recently.
But ten years ago that--well I'll explain that in a couple weeks. There
was an interesting thing that happened. In any case, you know, if you
want to publicize your theory, what you do is you find a bunch of
fairly prominent people in the field and you send them a big screen
saying, you know, you will regret it if you do not appreciate my
genius.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Do you ever read it? Do you read them?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Sometimes I do. We have a little
file in the library called the Crank File, in the Astronomy Department
library. And from time to time, you know, we assign graduate students
to figure out why they're wrong. We haven't done that lately.</p>

<p>Sometimes people amuse themselves by answering them. This can get
you into various kinds of trouble. There was the gentleman with the
theory of the Universe, which he illustrated in colored pencils, while
he was serving his time at a medium security institution in Washington
State. And we thought, you know, what a great way to--you know, much
better way to be spending your time in prison than some other things
you could think of. So, we sent him a bunch of textbooks and stuff.
Then we started getting letters back, saying, after I finish my
sentence, I'm coming to study with you, and explaining why he was
innocent of the crime of which he had been committed. And so, at a
certain point we started returning things, you know. No, terribly
sorry, this individual has left Yale. We don't know where he is,
whoever it was. This is Jerry Orosz who carried on this conversation
for a while. And so, you have to be a little bit careful.</p>

<p>And then--oh there was the guy--This was amazing. There was a guy
who showed up at the start of the semester. He's dressed in a suit and
tie, carrying a briefcase, walks into the department office and says,
"Where's my classroom? I'm supposed to teach cosmology." And he looked
very respectable. The secretary thought, not with us, you're not, so
sent him over to the Physics Department. He asked the same question of
the Physics Department. He had just walked in off the street with a
briefcase full of his textbook. And he was very annoyed that we hadn't
assigned him a classroom and assigned students to come and learn, you
know, his particular theory of cosmology. And in the end, he had to be
escorted off the premises, and asked never to return.</p>

<p>So yeah, all kinds of patent clerks in the world, but most of them
aren't Einstein. That's kind of the moral. And the reason you can
tell--you asked whether I read these things. It's very easy to tell
whether there's anything that you might be useful to read. Because what
these people tend to say when they are not worth reading is, they tend
to say that all previous science is wrong. I am revolutionizing things.
Einstein is wrong, they say.</p>

<p>But Einstein didn't say that Newton was wrong. That wasn't what
happened. That wasn't how a revolution works. You revolutionize science
only if the new theory encompasses what was previously known--the
previous theories. And this is this business of the parameter, gamma,
where under appropriate circumstances, gamma is one. And under those
circumstances, you reproduce the theory that was already in existence.
And so, you know, there's been hundreds and hundreds of years of
Newtonian physics, all of which is basically right, one way or another.
So whatever your new idea is has to encompass all the things that were
right about the old idea. And so, you don't overturn Newton. What you
do is, you demonstrate that Newton's theory is only a part of a bigger
theory. And then, the bigger theory is the new theory and it
encompasses new kinds of data and explains new kinds of things, while
simultaneously not overturning all the things that you know are right
about the old theory.</p>

<p>And this is the thing that the people who wish they were Einstein,
but aren't, don't understand. And so, anytime you see something where
you're--where they're going to revolutionize all of science, it's
certainly wrong. Because there's a large fraction of science in current
existence that is correct. And you have to understand that. And you
have to encompass it and go beyond that--but it's not going to get
overturned. The planets aren't going to stop going in Keplerian orbits
because somebody has a new idea. And so, it has to encompass the old
idea.</p>

<p>Recently, in conjunction, in part with Einstein Year, two years ago,
the historians of science have been rethinking what's going on with
Einstein, and what happened in that patent office. And there's a new
kind of idea that actually, it was--it wasn't that he was working in
obscurity and some--and, you know, flipping burgers or something--that
his work in the patent office was very important to the way he
developed his theory. And that one of the reasons Einstein did what he
did was he was working in a patent office and not in a university.
Because, what was he doing in the patent office?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that in the early part of the twentieth century,
one of the big set of inventions that was coming through were ways of
synchronizing clocks. It turn--because railroads had just been
invented. And until then, you had had a situation where every city had
its own time. Every city had a little observatory. They would figure
out when the Sun was directly overhead. They would proclaim that to be
noon. They'd fire off a whistle. Everyone would set all their clocks.
But that meant--but they didn't have time zones. And that meant that
every little town had a different time system. There was--Boston time
was different from Hartford time, was different from New York time by
22.5 minutes, or whatever the appropriate amount would be. And that's
all fine, if you move between these cities slowly. If you start running
trains, you've got to have--the train system has to have a unified
system of time, otherwise they run into each other. And there were
crashes and terrible things.</p>

<p>And so, then, you have to have--okay. Then you have to have Boston
and New&nbsp;York having the same time. So, how do you synchronize
those clocks? Well, you've just invented the telegraph, so you send
an--you send an electromagnetic signal at the speed of light from
Boston to New York, and then back again, in order to synchronize your
clocks. And there were various inventions that Einstein was reviewing
in the patent office to accomplish this. And so, in his job, in his day
job, he spent all his time thinking about clocks and time, and signals
moving at the speed of light. So, perhaps it isn't surprising that he
had deep insights into these kinds of things.</p>

<p>So, the current feeling among, at least, some historians of science,
is that the patent office was, in fact, key to Einstein's thinking. So,
he didn't come out of obscurity at all. He came out of the only place
where the surroundings were such that you would have thought these
thoughts. This is associated with a historian of science named
Peter&nbsp;Galison, among others, who wrote a book called <i>Einstein's
Clocks and Poincare's Maps</i> to try and demonstrate how the practical
work these people were doing influenced their theoretical work.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Was it triggered by one event?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Well no, he--was he triggered by
one particular event? What prompted him to think about this was a whole
series of experiments that had been carried out--all of which, as I
mentioned last time, one way or another, demonstrated that this
business that the speed of light was constant in all reference frames.
And that there was no ether through which was the medium that was
imagined to exist through which electromagnetic waves were supposed to
pass. And there had been a series of experiments to try and detect
slight changes in the speed of light when you put it on a rail--when
you put it on a train, right? It's all about trains and elevators,
which had just been invented. And--but it wasn't one particular
triggering event. There was this whole range of things.</p>

<p>And Einstein, it should be said, was, by far, not the only person
thinking about this. We call the transformations Lorentz
transformations, because there was a guy named Lorentz who thought them
up. Mathematicians like Poincare, physicists like Minkowski--there were
a whole bunch of people thinking about this, and it was an urgent
problem in physics. And so that had to be dealt with. And if Einstein
hadn't existed, it might have taken a little longer, but we would have
gotten special relativity in the end.</p>

<p>That's not necessarily true of general relativity, as I'll explain
in a second. General relativity--if Einstein hadn't existed, general
relativity might not have happened until the 1960s, because it was not
prompted by a range of experimental results. The other bunch of
experimental results that were prominent at the time were the atomic
physics experiments that lead to quantum mechanics, which Einstein had
a hand in, as well.</p>

<p>Okay, so, now let me move on to general relativity. That's a good
moment to make this transition. So, general relativity, known as GR,
for short, is now a theory of gravity. So, the part of Newtonian
physics that is overthrown, or encompassed, as I was saying, by special
relativity, are the Laws of Motion. Now, general relativity has the
law--those same laws of motion, but also has embedded in it a theory of
gravity, which is fundamentally different from the way Newton thought
about gravity. So, Newtonian gravity is thought of as a force. It's a
particular force. It's the force of gravity. There's a little equation,
the force of gravity is equal to the gravitational constant, <i>G</i>,
times the mass of one object, times the mass of the other object,
divided by the distance between them squared.</p>

<p>And the odd thing--and this was sort of the starting point of
Einstein's thought. The odd thing is these masses. And
because--remember, somebody asked me last time, what is mass? And I
gave you a whole thing about the inertial mass. How much it resists
being pushed. And that comes about from <i>F</i> = <i>ma.</i> And so,
the kind of mass that I defined last time is the inertial mass--how
much it resists being pushed.</p>

<p>And so, conceptually--the mass that's in Newton's equations of
gravity--conceptually, that's a different kind of mass. It doesn't have
to be the same number. This is gravitational mass, because it's defined
differently. It's defined not by how much an object resists being
pushed by a force--any force, but by how much the object creates a
particular kind of force. So, in this, it's how much it resists forces.
In this, it's how much the force is created. And these are conceptually
different things.</p>

<p>It turns out that to the best experimental evidence that you can
muster, which by now is many, many decimal places, these two kinds of
mass are exactly the same. This has an experimental consequence that
was known already to Galileo in the seventeenth century. Look what
happened. Supposing <i>M</i><sub>1</sub> is the Earth, and
<i>M</i><sub>2</sub> is some object that you're dropping from a high
tower. So, the story is, Galileo goes to the top of the Tower of Pisa.
He drops a cannonball, or something, and watches it fall.</p>

<p>Then what happens? You substitute <i>F</i><sub>gravity</sub> into
the equation of motion. And what do you get? So, you're using a
particular kind of force. So, you get <i>GM</i> of the object, <i>M</i>
of the Earth, divided by distance squared, where the distance is the
distance between the centers of the objects--so, this is basically the
distance to the center of the Earth--is equal to the mass of the
object, times its acceleration.</p>

<p>And, look. If this mass is the same as that mass, they cancel. What
does that mean? So, you can do this. It means the motion, the
acceleration of the object, doesn't depend on its mass. The
acceleration of the object will be the same for any object because, if
it has greater inertia, it also generates, by exactly a proportional
amount, a greater force. And so, everything falls from the tower at the
same rate. And that's what Galileo did. He brought up a cannonball, and
a wooden ball, and a whole bunch of other objects, dropped them, and
discovered that the Greeks had been wrong. The Greeks imagined the
heavier the thing is, the fast it falls. But the only reason you think
that is because of dropping things like feathers, which do fall kind of
slowly and erratically. That has nothing to do with gravity. That's air
pressure, right? And so, if you drop things that are heavy enough so
that air pressure isn't important, they fall at the same rate. So, that
is the experiment that proves that gravitational mass is the same as
inertial mass.</p>

<p>All other forces don't have this consequence. There is, for
example--well, let me not draw on the corner here. I'll be just like
the cranks. You know, I'll start drawing all the way around the edge of
the thing, here. So, let us go on. Let's see. There is, for example,
electrical force, which has a very similar kind of equation. That's a
constant, times the charge of one object, times the charge of another
object, divided by the distance between them squared. That looks almost
identical to what the gravitational force looks like.</p>

<p>But, because the charge of an object isn't equal to its mass,
different objects respond differently to--when put in--when an electric
force is exerted on them. If you compare a proton, which is a mass of
subatomic particle of charge one, with a positron, which is a low-mass
particle of charge one. And you put the same amount of force on them,
the positron will move much more, because it has so much less mass. And
so, different objects respond in different ways to all forces except
gravity.</p>

<p>So, the unusual thing about gravity--so, gravity is weird, because
the gravitational mass turns out to be exactly equal, at least, to the
best possible measurements, to the inertial mass. And there's no excuse
within Newtonian theory to explain why that might be, and why all
objects move--therefore, move the same when put in a gravitational
field.</p>

<p>Okay, so, this bugged Einstein. This is the kind of thing that
bothered him. And so, to explain this and other related, sort of
conceptual issues, he promulgated a completely different
theory--namely--so. Einstein says--okay.</p>

<p>So, gravity, Einstein says, is not a force. That's not the right way
to think about it. And so, what--how does this work, then? All right,
so point one. Objects move in a straight line, when they are not in a
straight line, in the absence of a force. This is Newton's first law,
or something. If you're moving at a constant velocity, you will
continue moving in the same direction, at the same speed, unless
something happens; like, a force is applied to you. If gravity isn't a
force, that should still be true. Objects are moving in straight lines
all the time, whether there's a gravita--whether there's gravity around
or not.</p>

<p>That seems very odd, because we know perfectly well that
things--that when you have a gravitational force, and you're in an
orbit, you go around in a circle, not in a straight line at all. So,
how does Einstein reconcile this with reality? And that's part two of
the theory.</p>

<p>Part two of the theory is that the presence of mass--inertial mass,
now--creates curvature in space-time, space and time. Now, how does
that help? That helps because you have to then go back and think: what
do you mean by going in a straight line if you're in a curved space?
I'll give you some examples of this that you can see in a minute. What
you mean by a straight line is the shortest distance between two
points.</p>

<p>Now, we know from experience--or many of us know from
experience--that on a curved spaced the shortest difference between two
points is not exactly what you would expect it to be. Has anyone flown
on an airplane from here to Asia, for example? Fly from New York to
Beijing. So, let's make a map, a flat map. So, here's a flat
space--north, east, west, south. Here's New York. Here's Beijing. And
you might imagine, if things were flat, that the way you would get--and
the quickest way that the airlines would save money, you know, because
they don't--is that they would fly directly east. Because it's more or
less at the same latitude, New York and Beijing.</p>

<p>But that isn't what happens. That isn't what happens at all. What
you do, if you fly that route, or if you go the other way to Europe,
wherever it is that you're going is, you fly this way. You go way up
north. You look down halfway through, there's the Artic. Why do you do
that? It's because the Earth isn't flat. The Earth is a sphere. And so,
what it really looks like is this. Here's the Earth. Here's New York.
Here's Beijing, and you fly this way, because that's the shortest
distance across a--the surface of the sphere, between two points. I
have a sphere somewhere.</p>

<p>Let's see, here's a sphere [holds up a basketball]. And this line
here--think of this as the equator. And if you go from here to here, it
would be the shortest distance between the two points--would be to go
right across the equator. But we're not going on the equator. We're in
the northern hemisphere. So now, I'm going to tip this upward so that
these two things are both in the northern hemisphere. And now this line
goes up and across. And if I tip it all the way up, so that you would
be dealing with two cities on the opposite side of the world, as New
York and Beijing, close enough, it goes--the closest line between them
doesn't go around this way, it goes straight up over the top. So, if
you project that onto a flat map, it looks like this. But in fact, on a
sphere, on the surface of a sphere, that is the shortest distance
between those two points. It's the exact same distance as it would be
in the equator. You just tip the thing up, and it's clear that this is
the long way around.</p>

<p>So, if you have a curved space and you're trying to get, in the
shortest way, from one point to another, and you don't know you're on a
curved space, you interpret it as a flat space, then you will interpret
the path that you take as curved. And so, Einstein's statement is that
the presence of mass doesn't exert a gravitational force. That's the
wrong way to think about it. What it does is, it creates a curvature in
the space-time. And so, then, objects traveling from one place to
another move in straight lines, defined as the shortest distance
between those two points. But if we're not taking the curvature into
account, it looks like it's going around in circles. All right. Tough
concept.</p>

<p>So, let's demonstrate this. I need three volunteers. Let's see, yes.
So, we're going to have--let's do some--let's have a visual metaphor
here. Three volunteers, come, come, come. I have, here, a space. This
is the space-time of the bed sheet, here. Everybody take a corner, and
I'll take one, too--oops, yeah I'll take this one. You go around that
end. All right, now, here's the deal. First thing is we want to
make--first, no gravity. So, let's have--let's make this flat. Pull it
out; I want a flat space-time, here.</p>

<p>Okay, now, this object is going to move across the space-time. And
if I start it toward you, to the extent that we're flat, here, and
there's no spin, it'll continue coming toward you. And you can send it,
you know, back to me that way.</p>

<p>Now, let us--oops. Let us add mass to the system. So, here's a mass,
and it's going to have the effect--let it sag--of curving the
space-time. So, now, what happens if I send this thing toward you? It
goes into orbit. Okay? And if it weren't for friction, and other
extraneous sources, you could send this thing sideways, and it would
stay in orbit going round and round, around that thing. And even if I
go a little bit faster, I can make it change directions. That one
didn't work so well. Let me see if I can do it better. Let's see if we
make this change--I'm going to start it that way, and we'll see if we
can make it turn left. Oh yeah, that was good. And then, it stops,
falls back, right? Because it's going at less than the escape velocity,
and falls back down onto--yeah, into the black hole, or whatever it
is.</p>

<p>So a black hole, by the way, in this metaphor, is something that's
sufficiently massive that it pulls the space-time down to infinity. And
you can imagine that this sheet, then, forms a cylinder, and drops
straight down to infinity. And therefore, you can't get out, if you're
at the bottom of that infinitely deep--what's called a potential well.
So--yeah, there we go. Yes, it went into orbit, cool. All right,
thanks.</p>

<p>So, this is kind of a visual metaphor for how a curved space can
create what looks like curved motion but actually isn't. Okay, at this
point we better stop for questions. In fact, why don't you do the--why
don't we do the question thing. Talk to your neighbor for a minute or
two. Come up with the perfect question, and in two minutes we'll start
answering them. So, take a couple minutes. Try and formulate the
perfect question. Talk to each other. When you have a good question,
put your hand up we'll start trying to answer them.</p>

<p>[For several minutes students are left to work in groups]</p>

<p>How we doing with time? Okay. So, don't you guys ask questions or
I'm in serious trouble here, all right. Yeah no, no, no. [Laughter] Is
the tenser re-normalizable? Is the stress energy tense--Under what
circumstances is the stress energy tenser invertible?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I have a question. What the heck did your email mean
last night?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I was dashing
out the door.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> We didn't understand the question and then we didn't
understand your answer to the question about the question.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> So, okay. That tells us how we're
going to grade this. Okay let's have some questions. Yeah go ahead.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I still don't exactly understand what the sheet is
representing.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> What the sheet represents; thank
you very much. What does the sheet represent in our metaphor, here? The
sheet is supposed to represent space-time. Space-time is--and now, I've
got to explain that, right? So, what is space time? Because it's
space-time that's doing the curving. It's--you can think of it as a
four-dimensional coordinate system, where the four dimensions are the
three familiar spatial dimensions, <i>X, Y, Z</i>, and <i>T</i> for
time. And you can understand where any given event, where an event is
something that happens, can be identified with four numbers. It's
spatial position--that's three numbers, and the time at which it
occurs.</p>

<p>Now, in order to get these things into the same units, you have to
actually represent this as the speed of light times time, because
that--multiplying by the speed of light turns time units into space
units, because this is miles per hour, or space per time. So, one year
of time is the equivalent of one light-year of distance. That's how it
converts. And so, one interesting thing--and, of course, the sheet,
there, was a two-dimensional space, and only had <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>
that could identify any point on the sheet. So, the metaphor is to use
two spatial dimensions to represent what is actually a
four--conceptually, a four-dimensional space. That's why it's a
metaphor and not something real. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yes, yes. Absolutely correct. Does
gravity bend time, too? It has an effect on time similar to time
dilation when you're going really fast. If you get really close to a
black hole, your clocks will slow down. Yeah, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Why is that?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Why is that? Let me--next time,
I'll write down the Schwarzschild metric, and I'll try and answer that
question. Let me go on, here, for a minute, and point out an important
thing about this agreement, here, which is--that means the Earth, in
its motion, for example, in one year--the time coordinate moves one
light-year, which is 10<sup>16</sup> meters. The space coordinate moves
2π times the semi-major axis, which is 1 Astronomical Unit. That's 2π
times 1.5 times 10<sup>11</sup> meters. That's something like
10<sup>12</sup> meters.</p>

<p>So, the Earth moves 10,000 times further in time than it moves in
space in a year. And that means that the Earth's motion in space-time
is almost precisely a straight line, going straight forward in time.
So, here's time. Here's, I don't know, the <i>X</i>-axis. And you could
imagine that as time goes on, the Earth, you know, moves around the
Sun. So its <i>X</i>-axis --so its <i>X</i>-coordinate goes back and
back--back and forth. Here's the Sun, which, you know, wiggles a little
bit, much less than the Earth, as we discussed.</p>

<p>But this picture, here, is inaccurate, because in fact this distance
here, which is half a year, is 10,000 times longer than this distance
here, which is half an orbit. And so--and so, in fact, the Earth's
motion is represented by something that's almost exactly a straight
line--so much so that I couldn't possibly draw the wiggle in a way that
you could see it. So, here's the Earth going forward in time. And the
wiggle is really small. That's not surprising, because the
gravitational force of the Sun is small enough so that the Earth's
orbit is correctly described by Newtonian physics.</p>

<p>And so, this is one of those situations where you have a Newtonian
physics in relatively low gravitational fields. And as the
gravitational fields get stronger, weird relativistic effects kick in.
But that doesn't happen for the Earth. So there's--the number is this.
Schwarzschild radius divided by distance, is the measure of how
relativistic an orbit is. And if this number is small, then you get
correct answers from the Newtonian theory. And we can work it out. The
Schwarzschild radius of the Sun, 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> meters. The
distance from the Earth to the Sun, 1.5 x 10<sup>11</sup> meters.
That's 2 x 10<sup>-8</sup> and that's a small number. So, Earth works
fine in a Newtonian sense. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is that <i>R</i> the radius of the orbit or the
radius of the [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> That is the distance of the moving
object from the center of the gravitating thing that's making the
curvature happen. Yeah. So, yes is the answer. It's the radius of the
orbit. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Was the theory of general relativity a theory that
was just promulgated, or does it actually have equations associated
with it?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh yes. Does it have equations
associated with it? You bet. You don't want to see them. There's a
branch of mathematics called differential geometry, because--what
happens is, this curvature stuff is all geometry. And the problem is
that the further away you get from an object, the less the space is
curved. So, the amount on the sphere, on the surface of the
sphere--it's curved the same way everywhere. So, the equations that
describe the curvature are the same at any point on a sphere. But you
can imagine something that starts out with strong curvature and tails
off. And then the amount of curvature at any given point is different
from any other point. So, you have to describe it with a differential
amount of curvature, and then integrate over the path that things take.
This gets heinous, and we're not going to go there. But I will show
you, next time, some specific examples of some of these equations,
because it'll help explain things like why space and time are reversed
inside an event horizon and stuff.</p>

<p>But, you bet, there's a whole mathematical theory. In fact, Einstein
was not the world's greatest mathematician and it took him until 1917
to get all this worked out. He had to go and get himself some math
tutoring at the University of Göttingen and--so that he could
understand the geometric properties. So, yeah, there's a big
mathematical theory behind it. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So, if gravity is not a force, how can you use <i>F
= ma</i>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> <i>F = ma</i> is a general equation
of motion. It doesn't have to be the force of gravity. There are many
other forces in the world.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> But when you're setting <i>F = ma</i> to <i>GMM</i>
or [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Right, so, that's the Newtonian
idea, that you set <i>F = ma</i> equal to <i>GMM</i> over
<i>D</i><sup>2</sup>. And the thing that prompted Einstein's thought
was the fact that the two different kinds of masses on each side of the
equation turned out to be equal. And you can see why this explains
that. Because, if what's happening is that you curve space, and then
things follow a trajectory dictated by the curvature of that space,
then it makes perfect sense that all objects follow the same
trajectory, regardless of their mass. Because they're not actually
being forced to move anywhere. They're just going in straight lines,
and straight lines are the same no matter what your mass is. And so,
that's why this kind of curvature provides an explanation for what, in
the Newtonian approximation, is the equality of the inertial and the
gravitational mass. How we doing? Oh, we've got some more time, good.
Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Would a clock really slow down as it moved towards
the [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] would you have a perception of
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Well, of course, you are a clock,
right? You're--no, you wouldn't notice. But what would happen is this.
Supposing you're falling into a black hole, or something. You look at
your clock. You feel your pulse, you know. Your pulse measured by your
clock has not changed. But you look back out into the world that is
distant from the black hole, and things are moving really fast out
there. And so, if you had two synchronized, identical clocks at the
start of your voyage, and you keep an eye on what's happening out here,
you will discover that, all of a sudden, it looks like your clock is
moving slow. And, all of a sudden, you know, people are aging and dying
back on Earth, while, you know, it's only been a week in your
perception.</p>

<p>And so, turn it around. You're sitting on Earth watching your friend
fall through--fall into a black hole. And it looks like he's slowing
down, and slowing down, and slowing down and maybe--and never really
quite gets to the event horizon, even in an infinite amount of time.
But the perception of the person falling through is that they just fall
through. It's just, the whole Universe is evolved in the time that
they've done it.</p>

<p>So, it's one of these weird things where time turns out--how fast
time passes turns out to be a property of who's doing the measuring.
Very strange concept, and very counterintuitive to the way we live our
life. Because we all think--because we live in low gravitational fields
at low speeds, we think time is an absolute thing that ticks onward for
everybody in the same way, but it turns out it isn't true.</p>

<p>Yes? And again, I'll show you an equation that--actually, this is
much easier to deal with in equations than it is conceptually, and I'll
show you an equation next time which may help.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Can you explain about the names behind the two
theories of relativity? I mean, it doesn't seem like the general theory
is a generalization of the special theory.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> It actually is, because it
incorporates aspects of the special theory. And it's a generalization
in terms of what's called the metric. The metric is the mathematical
formula that describes the curvature. And the special theory of
relativity is the special case where the metric is flat. And then, the
reason general relativity is a generalization is because it allows
other--many other kinds of metrics. Or, at least, that's one way of
thinking about it. Yes sir.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah well I--too small for me to
draw.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> The wiggle is from the motion of
the Earth around the Sun. And it's caused by--the mass of the Sun warps
the space--</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just--all I
meant in the second one--sorry, I didn't explain this clearly. All I
meant in the second one was that this one is inaccurate in terms of
scale.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Okay, oh I see.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> And that the scale, the true scale,
is such that this length ought to be 10,000 times longer than that. And
under those circumstances you'd never be able to see it. That's all I
meant by that. Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What happens to time when you're caught
traveling--you mentioned this, but what happens to time when you're
traveling close to the speed of light?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Slows down yeah. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> So, how does, how does this work?
Right. We are, you know--you can explain the motion of the Earth in
terms of these so-called space-time diagrams, where one--you take the
four-dimensional thing. You project it onto two dimensions. You can
write a space-time diagram for yourself, and you can explain all of the
motion and all of the things that happen by such a curved thing. So,
what happens if you jump, for example? In the Newtonian theory, you
jump, you ought to keep going straight up, except that there is a
force, which pulls you back down. So, that we understand.</p>

<p>What happens--how is that explained in general relativity? You jump
and you go in a straight line, but the straight line is through a
curved space--curved because of the presence of the Earth. And so, it
turns out that the straight line looks like this. It goes up and comes
back down again, in just the same way that the straight line between
New York and Beijing goes over the North Pole. It goes up and comes
back down again, because space-time is curved due to the gravity of the
Earth.</p>

<p>So, something that we perceive to be a curved trajectory--jumping
up, falling back down--if you project it into space-time, is actually
the closest distance between two events. So, there's two alternative
explanations of these things.</p>

<p>In the situation where you're nowhere near a black hole, it turns
out that, mathematically, they're exactly equivalent. If they're
exactly equivalent, it's much easier to calculate the Newtonian way,
and much easier to think about it. So, until you get into a situation
where the Schwarzschild radius is comparable to the distances involved,
you're way better off thinking Newtonian, because we're just better at
it. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I understand that in order to get units that you can
line up in any way, uniquely, you need to multiply time by a velocity.
But I'm a little confused about--I mean I know that <i>c</i> is this
really important number--</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> - but if the only reason why the wiggles in the
graph of motion are really tiny is because <i>c</i> is so enormous. I
mean -</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Couldn't you pick another
velocity?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What makes that an accurate scaling?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Okay, so, the reason that's an
accurate scaling is, one of the things that comes out of the theory of
relativity is that there is a natural unit. There's a natural set of
units. And the natural set of units are the units in which these
crucial constants, of which <i>c</i> is one and <i>G</i> is another,
and <i>H--</i>the Planck constant, which governs quantum mechanics, are
all equal to one. And that turns--those are called Planck units, and
they have--and the conversion between different kinds of energy, mass
to energy, things like that, all work out as equalities in the
particular set of units, where all those constants come out to be
one.</p>

<p>So, there is a reason why that particular velocity is chosen, and
it's not surprising, if you had to pick a velocity, that you would end
up with the speed of light, which has this sort of profound importance.
Okay, we'll continue next time.</p>
