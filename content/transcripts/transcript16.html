<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Welcome to part three of the
course. This is going to be about cosmology. One of the most amazing
things that's happened over the past half century or so is that
cosmology, which is the study of the Universe as a whole, has become a
scientific subject, and something that one can say something about in
scientific terms, rather than merely philosophical terms.</p>

<p>In recent years, in the past ten years or so, there has been kind of
a revolution in cosmology, which has come about because of the
discovery that the vast majority of the Universe is made out of stuff
that we have no idea what it is. So, the discovery is, we have no idea
what the Universe is made of. And that actually, you know, it doesn't
sound so good. It sounds like this is a big failure of science,
somehow.</p>

<p>But scientists are clever, so we describe it differently. What we
claim is that what has happened is that we have discovered dark energy.
Dark energy, what is that? We don't have a clue, but it's most of the
Universe. And we've discovered that it exists. So, that's kind of where
we are right now.</p>

<p>What I want to do over the next four or five weeks is talk about the
discovery of dark energy--how that was done. And now that we know that
it's there, but we don't what it is, what people intend to do about it.
And this is, I should say, only a relatively small fraction of modern
cosmology. If you want to know about many of the other interesting
things that are going in cosmology, you have to take a whole course, or
several courses, on this topic. Such courses exist. I recommend Astro
170 or 220 if you find yourself interested in this kind of thing.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, this one particular discovery--and, in fact, what
I'm going to be focusing on is not just dark energy, but one particular
way that dark energy--the first way. There are now other indications
that exist. One particular way in which dark energy has been
discovered. And so, it's a fairly narrow focus that I'll be taking
here, but that will enable us to get into some depth about how this
discovery was made.</p>

<p>So, let me let you in on the secret before we even begin. Dark
energy is something that you can't see. That's sort of its name. We've
done this twice already, right? We've discovered planets around other
stars--that you couldn't see the planets. How do you do that? You look
at the star--the motion of the star. We've discovered the existence of
black holes which, of course, you can't see. How do you do that? You
look at the motion of some star that is influenced by the existence of
the black hole. So, what are we going to do about dark energy? Well,
this isn't hard to extrapolate. What we're going to do is we're going
to look at the motion of things that we can see, and infer the presence
of dark energy.</p>

<p>And of course, how do we look at the motion? We look at Doppler
shifts. That will be another recurring theme. And so, the plan of
action here is actually not so different from something we've done a
couple of times before, although the context and the implications, and
the particular details, needless to say, are.</p>

<p>Okay. So, let's go back in time almost ninety&nbsp;years, back to
1920. So, supposing one were to give a course in Frontiers and
Controversies in Astrophysics in the year 1920. What would one have
been talking about? Frontiers and Controversies. The big issue, at
least in terms of cosmology, was the question of the so-called spiral
nebulae. These had been discovered over the previous few decades after
the invention of photography, allowed pictures of the sky to be
created. And as people took pictures of the sky, what they discovered
was, scattered all over the sky are these little spiral clouds, the
so-called spiral nebulae.</p>

<p>What are these things, they wondered. And, in particular, where are
these things? And there were two basic hypotheses. One was that these
are, sort of, clouds--shining clouds of gas. These were known to exist
in other kinds of shapes. So, these are clouds of some kind of glowing
gas, and that they are part of our so-called galaxy. Galaxy comes from
the Greek word for milk. It's basically Greek for Milky Way. The Milky
Way is this band of stars across the sky. It looks like just a white
streak. You can't see it in the city with city lights. You know, if
you've never seen this, go somewhere dark. Wait until the Moon goes
down. Get your eyes adapted and then look for the Milky Way. It's
really very spectacular. If you really want to do this right, do it in
the southern hemisphere, because the center of our galaxy is down
there. It's quite spectacular.</p>

<p>Anyway, it had been known since Galileo's time that what the Milky
Way really was, was a band of stars. And so--that there's this huge
bunch of stars out there, so faint, so packed together, we see it just
as a continuous band of light. And so, all these stars--that's our
galaxy. And the question was whether these spiral nebulae might be
little clouds of something or other scattered around our galaxy.</p>

<p>The alternative, less popular at the time, but perhaps more
spectacular, is that the spiral nebulae are galaxies themselves--are
whole galaxies of stars, different from our own galaxy. These were
sometimes referred to as island universes. So, the Milky Way is our own
galaxy, and each one of these tiny little spiral things is a galaxy
itself, located much, much further away, obviously, than any of the
stars that we can see.</p>

<p>And you can see that this is a question of some importance, in
particular, to how big you think the Universe is. If all these spiral
nebulae are part of our own galaxy, then maybe what the Universe is, is
one galaxy. And at that time, it was already starting to be known how
big the galaxy was, and so forth. But if each one of them is its own
galaxy, then obviously, the entire Universe must be much, much bigger,
because it contains thousands, perhaps millions, of individual
galaxies, each of them more or less like our own.</p>

<p>So, we know what the answer's going to turn out to be. This is
correct [points to "island universes" on slide notes]. But they didn't
know that in 1920. And, in fact, they staged what was called the Great
Debate in 1920, between a very famous astronomer named Harlow Shapley,
who was at Harvard. And he maintained that the spiral nebulae must be
part of our own galaxy. And so, he had many good reasons to think this.
There was a lot of evidence that the spiral nebulae couldn't be that
far away. They must be really quite nearby. And so, Shapely had, in the
true Harvard manner, all of the right arguments, and was completely
wrong. And his opponent, a man named Curtis, educated at Yale, but at
that point working somewhere else, turned out to be entirely right, but
totally lost the debate because he just didn't have that much evidence
backing him up. So, the intuition of the Yale man comes through.</p>

<p>So, this is a famous incident in the history of science. It garnered
enormous attention at the time. Remember, this is a year after the
eclipse expedition has verified Einstein's Theory of General
Relativity, so people are pretty excited about modern science at the
time. And this was reported widely in the press. So, this is another
one of our, sort of, science fables, here, "The Great Debate." And one
version of the moral of this story might be, you can have all the right
arguments and still be wrong--have many good arguments and still be
wrong, as Mr. Shapley turned out to be.</p>

<p>Interestingly, at the time, in 1920, they thought, you know, it's
going to take us a long time to really get to the truth of this, and
turned out not to be the case. Within just a few years after the debate
had taken place, this problem was totally solved. And the man who
solved it was perhaps the greatest observational astronomer of the
twentieth century--a man named Edwin Hubble, after whom a telescope was
subsequently named. And what helped solve this was simply better
equipment. And, in fact, starting kind of a trend that has continued
for a century now, what happened was--</p>

<p>So, Hubble was out in California, where there are nice, clear skies,
and persuaded a rich man to give a lot of money to build a really big
telescope. This was a 100" telescope. That's the diameter of the--the
diameter of the mirror. This is actually still in use, although the
site is no good because it's way too near to the lights of San
Francisco. But he took this brand new telescope. He looked at the
spiral nebulae. And he did the same thing to the spiral nebulae that
Galileo had done to the Milky Way. He resolved it into individual
stars. And he could see the individual stars in these spiral nebulae,
and discovered in the nearest of them that they were made up of stars.
And then, he noticed that the stars that were making them up were
incredibly faint. And that even the brightest stars in these things
were incredibly faint. And so, he inferred the distance to these things
by assuming that, you know, they're kind of ordinary stars, like any
other kind of stars, except they're way, way fainter, and therefore
they must be much further away.</p>

<p>And this was compelling evidence that these spiral nebulae really
were island universes--galaxies like our own. And the key thing to
do--that is, to have a telescope powerful enough to resolve some of the
nearby examples into individual stars. So, there are many galaxies.
This was known shortly after the Great Debate took place. And that made
the Universe very much larger than people had previously suspected,
because there are all these galaxies around.</p>

<p>So, Hubble was the great expert at observing galaxies. And so, the
next thing he decided he would look at is--okay, now we know these
things are galaxies, let's check out their-- you know, he took Doppler
shift measurements. He's trying to figure out the motions of
galaxies.</p>

<p>And so, he discovered a very strange thing. Namely, that they are
all going away from us. Every galaxy he measured was redshifted. And
so, by the usual Doppler shift interpretation of these things, they
must all be moving away from us. And Hubble went further, and he
created one of the most famous diagrams in all of astronomy, in which
he plots redshift--which is to say <i>Z</i>, which is to say radial
velocity divided by the speed of light, at least in the Newtonian
approximation, which he was working in, versus distance. So, he figured
out how far away these galaxies were. He measured their redshift. And
what he discovered is that these things were very tightly
correlated.</p>

<p>So, if you plot each galaxy, measure a distance and a redshift for
each galaxy, for a large number of galaxies, what you find is that they
line up like this. This is the so-called Hubble Diagram, and it's
basically the thing we're going to be talking about for the next five
weeks or so--is Hubble Diagrams, and what you can infer from them. And
the Hubble Diagram can be, sort of, summed up in an equation. If this
is a straight line, then it must be true that the velocity of a given
galaxy is equal to a constant, which was given the letter <i>H</i>, for
the Hubble Constant, times the distance. This is Hubble's Constant. And
that just basically says in algebra what this says pictorially, that
these things line up in a straight line.</p>

<p>The Hubble Constant is an extremely important number. You measure it
by creating these Hubble Diagrams and just measuring the slope of the
line. And the primary scientific purpose of the Hubble Space Telescope,
the largest and most expensive science project ever created, was to get
an accurate measurement of the Hubble Constant. So, all these beautiful
pictures you see are byproducts. The purpose of the thing was to
measure the Hubble Constant accurately. There had been, for many years,
a dispute over what the correct value was. This was resolved by the
Space Telescope and other things within the past decade. And this was a
big success. We now know what the Hubble Constant is. It's measured in
somewhat weird units. It's seventy or so kilometers per second, per
megaparsec [Mpc]. All right.</p>

<p>Now, let's pause there for just a moment. You can see why they use
this peculiar unit. Because you want to--they're measuring velocity in
kilometers per second, and they're measuring distance in megaparsecs.
Mega, of course, doesn't just mean big. It's a technical term. It means
a million. It means 10<sup>6</sup> parsecs. A parsec, you will
remember, is about three light years, or 3 x 10<sup>16</sup> meters, or
3&nbsp;x 10<sup>13</sup> kilometers.</p>

<p>And so, for each megaparsec that a given galaxy is away--and notice,
now, we've changed our units from parsecs, which we used for stars, to
megaparsecs. That's basically the change in the scale of the Universe
that came about when people realized that the spiral nebulae were
galaxies. So, now you have to talk about megaparsecs. In fact, now we
also talk, from time to time, about gigaparsecs, which are billions of
parsecs.</p>

<p>For each megaparsec that a galaxy is away from us, it moves
70&nbsp;kilometers per second more away from us. So, something that's
10 megaparsecs away ought to be moving 700 kilometers per second.
Something that's 100&nbsp;megaparsecs away would be moving
7,000&nbsp;kilometers a second away from us. And that's just an
expression of what this relationships is.</p>

<p>Hubble, by the way, got this quite wrong. He correctly lined them
all up, but his value for the Hubble Constant turned out to be about
500, in these units, which was quite wrong, and we'll talk about
that--why that was, later on. But, by now, with the Hubble Space
Telescope, we totally know this, and that's an important result.</p>

<p>Now, this diagram and this relationship are basically the key to
what we're going to be talking about. So, in fact, the fact that
there's this linear relationship tells you several things. It tells you
that the Universe is expanding. And because of that, it tells you that
the--indirectly, there's other evidence that has to be brought to bear,
as well, that the Big Bang exists. So, this is the basis of Big Bang
cosmology.</p>

<p>I don't want to talk about that right now. We'll talk about the Big
Bang on Tuesday. We'll have a whole big question-and-answer session,
so, bring all your questions about the Big Bang and cosmology. We'll do
that all up on Tuesday. What I want to talk about now is much more
mundane. Namely, how do you measure these points? How do you do this?
How do you create this diagram? This diagram has these fabulous
implications, but in order to understand what's going on, you'd better
know how you get the diagram in the first place.</p>

<p>Now, part of it's clear. The <i>x</i>-axis we understand fairly
well. Measuring radial velocity--that's easy. That's just the Doppler
shift. So, that comes directly out of a particular kind of measurement
that you can readily do. The <i>y</i>-axis is the biggest problem in
all of astronomy; namely, how do you measure the distance to
something?</p>

<p>And, if you think about it, that's what this Great Debate was all
about. Some people thought that the distances to these spiral nebulae
were a few hundred, or maybe a few thousand parsecs. Other people
thought they were millions of parsecs away, and it wasn't clear which
was right. And if you think about looking up into the sky, looking at
stars in the sky at night, you can see where there's a problem. You
look up there. You see a bunch of stars, and suddenly one of them
shoots across the sky. It's a shooting star. Except for the motion
across the sky, they don't look that different, and yet, some of
them--the fixed stars, are hundreds of light years away. The planets,
which look much the same to the naked eye are, you know, a million
times closer. And that shooting star is in the top of the atmosphere.
And it's very hard to tell what the distance is when you just kind of
look up there. And so, distance is hard. And that's basically the
problem I want to talk about for the rest of today's class. How do you
measure distances? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You said that redshift was easy, but how do we know
what the original wavelength is?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh, how do you know what the
original wavelength was? You make the assumption that atomic physics
and chemistry are the same in the distant galaxies as they are here,
and therefore, hydrogen should emit lines at the same frequency as they
do in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Now, one of the things you can do if you don't like what the
cosmological implications of things is, you can say, well, rather than
interpreting this as cosmology, let's just say that in distant portions
of the Universe, physics is different. If you go down that road, you
can get any answer you want. And this has been seriously discussed from
time to time.</p>

<p>All right. So, how do you measure distance? That's the key. Well,
there's one, and only one, kind of, direct way you could imagine doing
this. Here's the Sun. Here's the Earth going around the Sun. Here's a
nearby star. And here are a bunch of other, much further away stars.
They're all scattered around the sky. And you observe this nearby star
during the course of the year. As the year goes on, you observe it
repeatedly. You observe it from here, for example. And when you observe
it from here, it's in this direction, and therefore, it appears to be
in that position relative to the other stars. Whereas, when you observe
it here, it's in a little bit of a different position with respect to
the other stars. It looks like it's here. And so, if you observe this
star repeatedly over the course of the year, it appears to move back
and forth against the background of the other stars.</p>

<p>This is a triangle. We know what to do about triangles. You can
measure this angle because that's just the angular separation of the
two apparent positions of this star in the sky. We know this distance.
That's 1 Astronomical Unit, because this is the Earth going around the
Sun. And then, what we want to know is the distance to this star,
<i>D</i>. Let's call that <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>. And we know the
equation for this already. We've done this before. This is α =
<i>D</i><sub>2</sub> / <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>, where
<i>D</i><sub>2</sub>, in this case, is exactly 1 Astronomical Unit.</p>

<p>And you may recall that if you measure this in arc seconds, and you
measure this in parsecs, and you measure this in AU, you get a
consistent set of answers. And so, the way it works out is 1 / α, in
arc seconds, equals the distance in parsecs. And the reason that works
is because <i>D</i><sub>2</sub>, by this method, is always equal to 1
Astronomical Unit. If you try this on Jupiter, you have to account for
the fact that Jupiter's further away.</p>

<p>This is called the parallax method. It's common in surveying. You
know, you look at the same thing from two different places. You can
figure out distances by basically trigonometry, here. This is called
the parallax method. And a parsec--this is the definition of a
parsec--is one parallax second. It's a contraction. Because you measure
an arc second and the distance is one parsec. And that is the
definition of a parsec. That's why we use parsec as a distance
measurement, because it comes naturally out of this parallax
method.</p>

<p>And so, that's a fairly direct geometric method. This is a surveying
technique. This is how--and this is a straightforward way of getting
the distance. And the problem with this is that it only works on things
that are really nearby. Because we can measure, you know, maybe, a
hundredth of an arc second change in position, but no better than that.
And so, you can only get measurements of distances in this way out to a
few hundred parsecs. Works to a kind of maximum, given our current
instrumentation of a few hundred&nbsp;parsecs.</p>

<p>But the center of our galaxy is 8,000&nbsp;parsecs away. These other
galaxies are megaparsecs away. We can't be measuring 1 one-millionth of
an arc second, at least not at the moment, in terms of parallax. So,
this only works for the very nearest stars. And that's why there was
all this confusion about the spiral nebulae because, you know, if they
were 500&nbsp;parsecs away, you'd never be able to tell.</p>

<p>So, most other distance measurements--methods of distance--are some
form of what's called the Standard Candle Method. So, here's how the
Standard Candle Method works. It's a three-step process. Part one, you
look at something. You know how bright something is--how bright
something is. This is basically a version of what Hubble did when he
figured out that the spiral nebulae must be very, very distant, and
must, therefore, be island universes. You know how bright something is.
In the case of Hubble, he's looking at the brightest stars in the
galaxy. He figures they're about as bright as the brightest stars in
our own galaxy, so, he knows how bright they are.</p>

<p>Part two, you measure how bright the object looks. You take a
picture of it, or you count photons, or whatever it is that you do, and
you figure out how bright it looks. And obviously, for something of a
given brightness, the further away it is, the fainter it looks. And we
know exactly how that works. It's a distance-squared thing. If it's
twice as far away, it's a fourth as bright. If it's three times further
away, it's 1/9th as bright. It goes as one over the distance, squared.
This is a well-known fact. You can try this out with light bulbs at
home.</p>

<p>And so, if you know how bright it is, and you measure how bright it
appears to be, then you can compute the distance. Okay. And this is why
it's called a standard candle--oh, so, the way this is--how do you know
this? That's the big question. How do you know how bright the thing is
in the first place? And the answer is, usually, that you're looking at
something which is an example of a class of objects, like stars, or
bright stars, whose brightness is known.</p>

<p>And that's why you use the term, standard candle. Because here's a
bunch of things. They're all the same brightness. They all have the
same standard candle power. Some of them look fainter than others, but
ones that look fainter obviously have to be further away. And if you
know the true brightness of this class of objects, you can figure out
how far away any example of it is. Hence, standard candles.</p>

<p>And the problem with this is this phrase here, as you can pretty
clearly see. If you get it wrong--if you make the wrong assumption
about how bright these objects are, you're going to screw this up
completely, and that's what Hubble did. Hubble was looking at a
particular kind of bright star, which he thought he knew how bright it
was, and he was wrong. And so, he got the wrong Hubble Constant.</p>

<p>Now, because he used the same kind of star in all his galaxies, he
got it the same amount wrong for all these different galaxies. So, they
still lined up. They just lined up along the wrong track. So, it was
still true that something that he thought was twice as far away as
something else was in fact twice as far away as something else. He just
got both of those numbers wrong by the same factor.</p>

<p>Okay. This brings us to the awkward question of, "How do you measure
brightness?" And now, we have to talk about one of the great
impediments to learning astronomy--namely, the magnitude scale.
Astronomers count brightness upside down and logarithmically. And I am
now obliged, by my membership in the astronomical community, to inflict
this upon you. So, the magnitude scale--this is how we measure
brightness. It's upside down and logarithmic. And the key numerical
relationship that works looks like this. If you subtract the magnitude
of one object from another, that equals minus five halves times the log
of the ratio of the brightnesses [-5/2 log (<i>b</i><sub>1</sub>
/<i>b</i><sub>2</sub>)]. Don't panic. The magic word, here, is "help
sheet," which will be posted later this afternoon. So, this is a key
equation.</p>

<p>So, let me just define the terms. This is the magnitude of two
different objects and this is the brightness of the two objects.
Whereby "brightness," I mean something sensible, like how many photons
per second do you get from them, or some other kind of true measure of
how bright they are.</p>

<p>Now, this is a somewhat awkward equation, because it's a relative
equation. It doesn't tell you what the magnitude of either one of these
things is. What it tells you is the magnitude of one compared to
another. So, in order to figure out the magnitude of something, you
have to know the magnitude of something else. And so, you need one
other piece of information to have this be useful, which is that they
have defined a particular star to have magnitude 0. The star, Vega, is
defined to have magnitude 0. So, if you start with Vega, you can figure
out the magnitude of any other given object.</p>

<p>Actually, this is now causing trouble, because it turns out that in
the far infrared, Vega is variable. And that's kind of unfortunate for
the basis of the whole magnitude system to turn out to be variable.
But, they've coped with that in various ways.</p>

<p>All right. Let me pause and remind you of some things about
logarithms, which you may have forgotten. What's the definition here?
The logarithm of 10<i><sup>x</sup></i> = <i>x</i>. That's the
definition of a logarithm. So, for example, the logarithm of 3 x
10<sup>2</sup> is equal to the logarithm of 10<sup>1/2</sup> that's 3
times 10<sup>2</sup>, is equal to the logarithm of 10<sup>2.5</sup>.
Because when you multiply 10<i><sup>x</sup></i> by
10<i><sup>y</sup></i> you get 10<i><sup>x</sup> +</i> y, which is equal
to 2.5. That's an example. More examples on the help sheet. Just, in
general, log (10<i><sup>x</sup></i> x 10<i><sup>y</sup></i>) = <i>x</i>
+ <i>y</i>. Because when you add those together, that's how it works.
log (10<i><sup>x</sup></i> / 10<i><sup>y</sup></i>) = <i>x</i> -
<i>y</i>. Again, because of the way logarithms multiply together. And
the logarithm of--let's see, 10<i><sup>x</sup></i>, raised to the
<i>m</i>th power, is equal to <i>mx</i>
[log([10<i><sup>x</sup></i>]<sup>m</sup>) = <i>mx</i>].</p>

<p>This, by the way, is why logarithms are so incredibly useful. You
should always do all your arithmetic in logarithms. You should just
automatically convert everything in your head into logarithms. In fact,
in the days before calculators, this is how people used to do
arithmetic. This is how slide rules work, I should say. They mark the
thing off logarithmically and then you move them back and forth. And
people, you know--if you memorize, like, ten logarithms of a few
convenient numbers, you can do all sorts of calculations in your head
because multiplication turns into addition, which is much, much easier
to do. And so, if you can convert things into logarithms in your head,
then all you have to do is add numbers. That's easy.</p>

<p>Similarly, taking something to the <i>m</i>th power, for example,
taking the square root of a number, or taking the cube of a number, or
something like that, reduces down to multiplication. It's hard to take
a square root of a number in your head, but it's easy to divide a
number by two, which is the equivalent of taking a square root. So, if
you're thinking in logarithms, all you got to do is divide it by two,
and you can amaze your friends by doing square roots in your head--if
your friends are the kinds of people who are amazed by that kind of
thing. Mine are. And so, I recommend this to you. If you have to prove
that you've learned something in college, spend a half hour memorizing
ten different logarithms and then just blow people's minds by taking
square roots on bets. Okay.</p>

<p>Or you can do problem sets in Astronomy 160. For example,
Sirius--the star Sirius, which is the brightest star in the sky, is
about three times brighter than Vega. So, what's its magnitude? What's
its magnitude? Well, let's write down the equation. Magnitude of Sirius
minus the magnitude of Vega is equal to -5/2 log of the brightness of
Sirius, divided by the brightness of Vega.</p>

<p>Now, any time you see three times brighter or twenty times fainter,
or anything of that kind, what you're really talking about is a ratio.
If Sirius is three times brighter than Vega, that means the brightness
of Sirius divided by the brightness of Vega is three. That's what that
statement means. And so, we can just plug it right in. -5/2 log (3).
Because Sirius is three times brighter than Vega, so that ratio is
equal to 3. What's the log of 3? One half. Thank you very much. This is
equal to - 5/2 log (10<sup>1/2</sup>). You will remember that the
square root of 10 is 3. So, 3 is also equal to π, but for logarithms,
the important thing is that 3 is equal to the square root of 10. And
so, this is (-5/2) x (1/2). -5/4.</p>

<p>Now, the magnitude of Vega, we know. That's 0. So, the magnitude of
Sirius is equal to -5/4. This is what I mean by the fact that the scale
is upside down. The brighter the star is, the lower--or, if it goes
through 0, the more negative the number becomes. Minus 1 is a brighter
star than 0. 0 is a brighter star than 2; 2 is a brighter star than 5,
and so forth. So, low numbers are bright. The magnitude of the Sun,
obviously extremely bright when we look at it, turns out to be -26.5.
And the magnitude of the faintest star that can be seen with the Hubble
Telescope is about +30, which is incredibly faint.</p>

<p>And that, by the way, is why, again, why logarithms are such good
news. Because the entire range of things we can see in the sky goes
from -26 to +30. Those are numbers you can get your mind around. In
fact, the difference in brightness between those things is a number
that I can't even pronounce. And so, much easier to deal with
magnitudes.</p>

<p>All right. Now, that has to do with how bright things are, how
bright things appear to be, or how bright they are. But remember what
we're trying to do. We're trying to compare how bright something is,
intrinsically, to how bright it looks. And this gets you into the
question of--there are actually two kinds of magnitude. The intrinsic
brightness of an object is something called absolute magnitude, whereas
the observed brightness is referred to as apparent magnitude. And now,
the astronomers screw you up again, because we have different symbols
for the apparent magnitude and the absolute magnitude. The absolute
magnitude is given a symbol capital <i>M</i>, and the apparent
magnitude is given the symbol small <i>m</i>. And the problem is that
you can't actually tell the difference between those two in my
handwriting, and probably yours as well. So, this leads to untold
confusion, but that's the way life is. And the relationship between
these two has to relate to distance.</p>

<p>Okay. Before we get there, the definition of absolute magnitude.
You'll notice that in the previous comparison of Sirius to Vega, I was
talking about apparent magnitude. How bright it looks in the sky.
Absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude if the object
in question were exactly 10 parsecs away. So, the Sun has an apparent
magnitude, as I said before, -26.5, but it's actually not that bright
of a star. If you took the Sun out to a distance of 10 parsecs, its
magnitude would be 4.7, which is among the fainter stars you could see
in the sky. And so, the absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.7, even
though its apparent magnitude is - 26.5.</p>

<p>So, it turns, for example, that the star Sirius is about 3 parsecs
away. And so--oh, I haven't told you an important thing yet. We'll come
back to this in a second, though. The problem set problem obviously is
going to be what is the absolute magnitude of Sirius, but I have to
write down the formula first.</p>

<p>Little <i>m</i>, that's the apparent magnitude, minus big <i>M</i>,
that's the absolute magnitude, is equal to 5 times the logarithm of the
distance over 10 parsecs. Now, notice what happens. If the distance is
equal to 10&nbsp;parsecs, then you've got the log of 1. What's the log
of 1? Zero. Thank you very much. Because this is the log of
10<sup>0</sup>. log 10<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;= 0. And so, if the log of this
thing is 0,&nbsp;then this right-hand side is 0. So, at a distance of
10 parsecs, the apparent magnitude is equal to the absolute magnitude,
because <i>m</i>&nbsp;- <i>M</i> = 0, which is exactly what the
definition was. So, that works.</p>

<p>So, example. Sirius. So, what is the absolute magnitude of Sirius?
All right. Here we go. The apparent magnitude, we figured out just a
minute ago, is - 5/4, minus the absolute magnitude, which is what we're
trying to figure out. 5 log (3 /10), which is 1/3, which is equal to 5
log(10<sup>-1/2</sup>). 3 = 10<sup>1/2</sup>; 1/3 = 10<sup>-1/2</sup>,
which is - 5/2. That 5 comes from here. The -1/2 comes from here. So,
<i>M</i> = 5/2, let's see, minus 5/4, is equal to 5/4. And that is the
absolute magnitude. I'm sorry. Oh you want me to do--okay, sure. So, we
okay to here?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> So oh, oh, okay, fine. Log of--this
is actually an important point. Log(1/3), that's what we're going to
try and do, is equal to log (1/10<sup>1/2</sup>).
1/10<i><sup>n</sup></i> = 10<i><sup>-n</sup></i>. That's the key thing.
And so, this is the log of 10 to the minus one half
[log(10<sup>-1/2</sup>)] That, then, means that 5 log (1/3) = 5 x
(-1/2) = - 5/2. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> There are no units--yeah,
magnitudes are just numbers. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Ah, well, what I did--sorry, I
skipped a step. To start from that. -5/4 - <i>M</i> = -5/2. So, I
multiply both sides by negative 1, then I subtract 5/4 from both
sides.</p>

<p>You got to keep the minus signs straight. The easiest way to make
mistakes in this is to get the thing upside down and lose track of
where your minus signs are, which is really easy to do, because the
whole scale is backwards. So, you know, -5/4 is bright, whereas 5/4 is
faint. And so, you're--one is constantly getting these things upside
down. Be careful. Look at your answers to see it makes sense. If some
incredibly faint galaxy turns out to have a magnitude of -50, that's
almost certainly wrong, because that's much brighter than the Sun.</p>

<p>All right. So, now. Now, we can actually do the Standard Candle
Method. Here's the key problem. If you observe a star like Sirius and
you--I don't know, you take its spectrum, or some alien comes down and
tells you this star is just like Sirius, or however you work this out.
If you observe a star like Sirius and measure its apparent magnitude to
be 8.75, how far away is it? And now, we're back to where we were
twenty minutes ago, before I started all this nonsense. Namely, we're
trying to measure the distance of something, which was the whole
purpose, as you may recall. So, how far away is it? Let's see.</p>

<p><i>m</i> - <i>M</i> = 5 log (<i>D</i> /10 parsecs). The apparent
magnitude is 8.75. The absolute magnitude, we just figured out, is
5/4--1.25--is equal to 5&nbsp;log (<i>D</i>&nbsp;/ 10 pc). And you'll
notice I've chosen my numbers carefully, because this is going to work
out well. This is 7.5, and I'm going to divide both sides by 5; 7.5 / 5
= log (<i>D</i> / 10&nbsp;pc).</p>

<p>Or, 1.5 = log (<i>D</i> / 10&nbsp;pc). Now what do I do? Yeah,
exactly. You have to take 10 to the power of both sides. Whenever
you're stuck with log of something and you don't want the log of the
something, you want the actual something itself, what you got to do is
10<sup>1.5</sup> = 10<sup>log (<i>D</i>/10pc)</sup>. Ten to the log of
anything is equal to itself. So, this is <i>D</i> / 10 parsecs. And
thus, what's 10<sup>1.5</sup>?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Thirty.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Thirty, yes.</p>

<p>10<sup>1.5</sup> = 10<sup>1</sup> x 10<sup>1/2</sup> = 3&nbsp;x
10<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;= 30.</p>

<p>So, 30 = <i>D</i> / 10&nbsp;parsecs. And <i>D</i> is equal to 300
parsecs. And for the person who asked about units, which was a very
good question, this is where the units come back. It's because there's
this 10 parsecs embedded inside the equation. And so, the unit of
length comes back here.</p>

<p>And so, that's how you measure distance. You know how bright
something is, probably by having looked at some other, more nearby
example. You measure how bright it looks. You compare those two things,
and out pops the distance. So, this is done, usually, in the form of
what's called the distance ladder, which we will talk about much more
in section. So, you'll get many more opportunities to do this.</p>

<p>Nearby stars, you measure the distance in parallax--from the
parallax method. Then you find examples of similar stars. You measure
the apparent magnitude. You assume the absolute magnitude to be the
same as the absolute magnitude for things you already know the distance
to. You assume the absolute magnitude. And you compute the distance.
This, then, gets you new--this tells you that you learned from this,
the absolute magnitudes of brighter things. Not just stars, but whole
galaxies, supernovae, all sorts of things--brighter things, which you
can then measure further away.</p>

<p>And just to conclude, you can see pretty clearly that this method is
fraught with potential problems. Because every time you go through
this--you know, that's a swear word in science. You're making an
assumption, and that assumption can lead you astray. And so, the whole
history of cosmology, since 1925, is in that word. Assuming the
absolute magnitude of things for which you're trying to measure the
distance, so you can put them on the Hubble Diagram, so that you can
deduce the rate of expansion of the Universe, and thus its age and
ultimate fate. So, it all rests on this little point embedded inside
the Standard Candle Method, which will be discussed at great length.
Okay, that's it for today.</p>
