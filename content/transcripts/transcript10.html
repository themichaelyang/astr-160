<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Okay. The subject is special
relativity. And right at the end of last class, I had written down this
factor, gamma. And gamma is the key thing, which tells you how
relativistic you are. Gamma = 1 over the square root of [1 -
(<i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>)]. And we talked about
this factor a little bit. If <i>V</i> over <i>c</i> is equal to zero or
approaches zero, then gamma, obviously, is 1. And when gamma is 1,
that's the Newtonian case--then, everything is just like Newton's law
said.</p>

<p>Okay. On the other hand, as <i>V</i> over <i>c</i> goes to 1--that
is to say, as the velocity approaches the speed of light, this gamma
factor goes to infinity, because 1 minus 1 in the denominator--that's
zero in the denominator, so the thing has to go to infinity. And then,
all these bizarre relativistic effects start taking place. And the one
we talked about in particular came about from an example of how this
gamma is used--namely, that the relativistic mass is equal to gamma
times the rest mass, which is the Newtonian mass. And, obviously, if
gamma = 1, then the Newtonian mass is equal to the--then, the mass is
equal to the Newtonian mass, and you're in Newton's laws, and
everything is fine. When the velocity approaches the speed of light,
then this total relativistic mass goes to infinity--the consequence of
which is that you can no longer accelerate, regardless of how much--so,
no more acceleration--regardless of how much force is applied, because
force equals mass times acceleration. And if the mass is infinite, then
any amount of force will not give you an acceleration. An acceleration
is a change in velocity, and so, the consequence of this is that you
can't go faster than the speed of light. It's also another side
consequence of this--sorry--there was? Oh, excellent, yes ask it.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible.]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> <i>V</i>--okay. <i>V</i> is the
velocity that something is traveling. There's no escape velocity here,
at the moment. There are all kinds of different <i>V</i>s floating
around, so it's important to keep them straight. Yeah, can't--you can't
go faster than the speed of light.</p>

<p>A side comment from this is that photons, particles of light, which
obviously, by definition, do go at the speed of light, have to have
zero rest mass--because otherwise they'd have--they'd end up having
infinite mass and infinite energy which isn't--which isn't physical.
So, photons which go at the speed of light, for which gamma is
therefore infinite, have to have <i>M--</i>this little
<i>M</i><sub>0</sub> here, equal to zero. So, you have zero times
infinity, and that can equal a finite number, otherwise they'd have
infinite energy. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I was just wondering if we're talking about velocity
as a factor or, like, the speed of light?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> At the moment what I'm talking
about is velocity as a speed. So, I'm talking about the magnitude of
the velocity. And you can tell, actually, that that's the case, because
it comes in as the velocity squared. So, even if it's a vector, when
you square it, that gives you a scalar quantity.</p>

<p>Okay. So, let me go on from here and talk about an intermediate
case. We've talked about <i>V</i> equals zero, we've talked about
<i>V</i> equals <i>c</i>. Let me talk about an intermediate case. And
the particular intermediate case--and this will show up on your problem
set – this is the thing we didn't get to on Thursday. This is what's
called the post-Newtonian approximation. This is when you're just a
tiny little bit relativistic. So, <i>V</i> over <i>c,</i> or more
properly, <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> is small, but not
zero.</p>

<p>And here, a little mathematical concept that may have flashed before
your eyes when you were in eleventh&nbsp;grade, or something, comes in,
which is the series expansion. We won't do the mathematics of this, but
here it is. If you take 1 plus epsilon [ε]--and I should say, epsilon
is a--used by mathematicians to mean something small. Famous
mathematician named Erdos used to refer to children as "epsilons." That
seems to be carrying it a little bit too far. But, this is how
mathematicians think. So, epsilon, in this case, is something that's
much, much less than 1.</p>

<p>And if you take 1 plus epsilon--so that's a number that's slightly
greater than 1--and you take it to the <i>n</i>th power, you can then
expand this as a series. And the series goes like this: 1 + <i>n</i> ε,
plus a bunch of other terms, each of which is multiplied by a higher
power of epsilon. So, there's a term in ε<sup>2</sup> and there's a
term in ε<sup>3</sup>, and so forth. And this is an infinite
series.</p>

<p>But the thing is, if epsilon's small, then ε<sup>2</sup> is even
smaller. So, if epsilon's already small and <i>n</i>ε is pretty small,
then ε<sup>2</sup> is far smaller than that, ε<sup>3</sup> yet smaller,
and these are negligible. And so, the approximation is, (1 +
ε)<sup>n</sup> is approximately equal to 1 + <i>n</i> ε, if epsilon is
much, much less than 1.</p>

<p>So, here's what we're going to do. We're going to use this series
expansion, and we're going to generate expressions for some things--in
particular, the mass, but some other things, too--where the 1 is the
Newtonian term. And the thing represented by this <i>n</i> ε, which is
much smaller, is a correction to the Newtonian term, and is the first
sign that things are becoming relativistic. So this is, in this
context, going to be a Newtonian term, and this is the post-Newtonian
approximation. Okay.</p>

<p>Oh, so, let's just do an example. Let's think about the motion of
the Earth--the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Earth's orbit, you may
recall, from the last section of the class, how fast the Earth moves.
It's about 3 x 10<sup>4</sup> meters per second. Thirty kilometers a
second. The speed of light is 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters per second. And
so, <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;/ <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> = [(3 x
10<sup>4</sup>) / (3 x 10<sup>8</sup>)]<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>-8</sup>.
And so, that quantity, which is going to turn out to be the
post-Newtonian effect, is one part in 10<sup>8</sup> for the Earth's
orbit. And so, pretty small. Considering that we think that 9 = 10,
something in the eighth decimal place isn't going to do a lot of
damage. So, it's not a particularly relativistic situation.</p>

<p>All right, so, now I want to go back and I want--that's just an
aside. I want to go back and apply this approximation to gamma. Gamma
is equal to 1 / (1&nbsp;- <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>),
the whole thing to the ½ power. That's (1 - <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> /
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>-1/2</sup>. I got to get a better pen, sorry
about that. And now, this can be expanded. This can be expanded in just
this kind of way. The first term is 1. Epsilon is -
<i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p><i>n</i> is - ½. Minus times a minus is a positive, so this is plus
1/2 <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>--plus additional terms,
the first of which is (<i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>)
<sup>2</sup>, which in the case of the Earth would be 10<sup>16</sup>.
So, it would be vastly smaller still, so, we ignore that. And so
that--and so, you can substitute this for gamma in situations where
<i>V</i> is kind of small. For example, let's go back to this mass
equation. 1&nbsp;+ 1/2 <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.
This is the total mass. Now--oh, let's separate these terms out.
<i>M</i><sub>0 --</sub>that's the Newtonian term. And now, here's a
post-Newtonian approximation.</p>

<p>1/2 <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> divided by
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. Okay, high school physics experts, do you
recognize this term? Kinetic energy. Absolutely right. This is from
high school physics. The kinetic energy--that is to say the energy in
the motion of this object. So what is this whole term? This whole term
is the kinetic energy. So, <i>M</i> is equal to the Newtonian rest
mass, plus the kinetic energy divided by <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Now, you'll recall that <i>E</i> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>M</i>.
So, this is the mass equivalent of the kinetic energy. So, given this
nice relativistic idea that mass and energy are interchangeable, well,
here it is. Here is the kinetic energy expressed in terms of mass. And
so, this little equation <i>M</i> = <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> γ has a
variety of consequences. When <i>V</i> / <i>c</i>--<i>V</i><sup>2</sup>
/ C<sup>2</sup>, really, goes to zero, then it's just Newton. It just
says, mass equals mass, because gamma is equal to 1. And that expresses
an important Newtonian concept, that the mass of something is an
intrinsic property of that object, which doesn't change--which is how
things are in Newton, but not how things are relativistically.</p>

<p>In the other extreme, where <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> /
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> approaches 1, this equation expresses the fact
that light--the speed of light is a speed limit. And in the
post-Newtonian case where <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>
is small, but not zero, this same expression expresses the fact that
<i>E</i> = <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>So, all three of these concepts come out of the same equation. It's
this kind of thing that makes physicists say things like, the theory of
relativity is incredibly beautiful. It's hard to know--I realize, it's
hard to know what that means, you know. What makes a piece of
mathematics beautiful? It's when you get a situation like this, where a
simple mathematical concept sort of spawns all kinds of new and
unexpected ideas, depending on how you look at it--and that they all
kind of come together as one.</p>

<p>I have this vivid memory in graduate school, I was sitting in a
class, you know, and the professor was doing the thing that professors
do. He was writing down all kinds of miscellaneous information really,
really fast, from relativity theory and nuclear physics. All sorts of
stuff was going up on the board. I was doing the thing that students
do, where you desperately try and write it all down, so that you can
then go back and figure out what the hell he was talking about later.
And suddenly, in the midst of this rather typical class, I realized
what was happening: that in about twenty&nbsp;minutes, he was going to
put all this stuff together and prove Chandrasekhar's limit. We talked
about Chandrasekhar's limit a week or so ago. That's the limit whereby
a white dwarf can't be bigger then 1.4&nbsp;times the mass of the Sun
or it continues to collapse. And, I suddenly saw where all this was
going and I sort of wrote down in my notebook, "Chandra," and
underlined it, put my pencil down. And then, I just watched for twenty
minutes. It was great. It was--the only thing I can compare it to is
listening to a great piece of music, because it kind of unfolds in
time, and you see where it's going, and it's just a great feeling.</p>

<p>So, don't be condescending to the physics majors when they're
working like hell on those problem sets late on a Thursday night,
because they have access to realms of aesthetic experience that you can
only imagine.</p>

<p>But perhaps--it's true, it's true, I promise. But you have to work
hard to get there and ask questions. So, at this point, let's do the
question thing. Here's what I'd like to do: talk to the people around
you. Introduce yourself to the people around you--groups of two, three
or four will do fine. And come up, in consultation with your neighbors,
with a question to ask. Now, this could either be a question of
something that you guys don't understand about what I've said, or
something where the question, if answered, would deepen your
understanding beyond what I've said. So, take a couple minutes. Talk to
your neighbors. Make a friend. Think of a question, and in a couple
minutes' time, we'll regroup and I'll answer some of the questions. If
your particular question doesn't end up being answered, you know, hand
it in at the end, so that I know what you were thinking of--and so,
definitely write them down. And we'll try this out. Let's see how this
goes. So, introduce yourself to your neighbors and come up with a
question. And when you have it, put your hand up and ask it. We'll come
around and ask.</p>

<p>So here's the scheme: when they start having questions, we'll go
around and try and answer some of the early ones.</p>

<p>So, talk to each other. Everyone should join in. Yes ma'am?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I have a question. I think it's probably from last
class.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What exactly is the difference between the Newtonian
mass and this mass we're talking about?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> So, this is the inertial mass which
goes into <i>F</i> = <i>ma.</i> And in the Newtonian concept, that's
always the same number for a given object. But not in--but in the
Newtonian case it isn't--in the relativistic case it isn't. So, that's
an excellent question.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So, should that be our question?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> That could be a question. I mean,
that could be, but feel free to think of another one. But that's
certainly a good one.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What is its [inaudible] if you're looking at a
basketball [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] which is the mass we're talking
about?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Okay, so, if it's moving slowly, it
doesn't matter. They're the same. And so, that's why you don't notice
this in everyday life. It's the amount--it's the extent to which it
resists being accelerated.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> And this can be that?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> That's this, yeah. That's the
combination of the two. It's the inertial mass. How much extra force
does it take to move the thing?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So this gets really [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Big.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> -big, when this gets really small?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> No, this gets big when this
goes--when this gets big. Well, this gets big when this gets big.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> And when this gets big then it's
hard to move.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> And when this gets infinitely big,
it's infinitely hard to move.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Okay. So, this always stays the same. This is just
mass?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yes, that's right. That's an
intrinsic property of the object. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible] an equation that says <i>M</i> equals
<i>M</i><sub>0</sub> plus [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> And then immediately after it says <i>E</i> /
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;= <i>M</i>. What happened to the
<i>M</i><sub>0</sub>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh, so, the thing on the
right--that's a good question. The thing on the right is a general
statement. It doesn't apply specifically to this case. The way it
applies is that <i>M</i> is equal to <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> plus the
kinetic energy over <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, because those are two
different kinds of mass. So it's true both ways. It's just--remember,
kinetic energy is not the only kind of energy. So, on the first
equation it says, kinetic energy plus some other kind of energy. So,
you could say that <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> has a rest energy, which you
would then divide by <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. And you would have to add
those two things together to make <i>E</i>. So, <i>E</i> is a sum of
two different kinds of energy. Good. Good question. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What's mass?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What's mass?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> What's mass? Okay, I've
heard--that's the second time I've heard that question.</p>

<p>All right. I've now heard the same question twice, so let me answer
it, and then we'll ask for other things. The same question, which has
been asked in a couple of different ways, is, what is mass? That's an
excellent question, because it's awfully hard to parse what's going on
with this <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> and this other kind of <i>M</i>, and
stuff, if you don't know what the concept means. So, that's a really
good question.</p>

<p>What's mass? Mass is defined--you can think of it this way. What is
mass? Mass is defined as from this equation, in a certain sense.
<i>F</i> = <i>ma</i>. It tells you, for a given object, how hard it is
to move--or, more precisely, how hard it is to accelerate. So, higher
mass requires greater force to accelerate by a certain amount. It's a
property of an object, and it tells you how much it resists being
pushed around. It's sometimes referred to as "inertial mass" for this
reason. It's an expression of the object's inertia--how much it resists
being accelerated.</p>

<p>And so, in Newtonian physics, this is purely a property of the
object itself. You can say, if you've got a basketball, or if you've
got a car, or something, that the car has more mass than the
basketball. Why? Because if I go--do I have a basketball? I don't. All
right, car, a car has--the lectern has more mass than the little piece
of cardboard here, because if I apply force to the cardboard I can move
it. And if I apply the same amount of force to the lectern, I move it a
whole lot less. And so, what is the difference between those two things
since the force applied is the same? The difference is that this one
has a whole lot more mass.</p>

<p>And in Newtonian physics, the mass is a property of the object. In
Einsteinian physics, there is something that's the property of the
object--that's its rest mass. But the inertial mass, the amount by
which it resists being pushed, is also a property--not just of the rest
mass, but also of its motion. So, if this were moving at a large
fraction of the speed of light and I applied some kind of force to it,
it wouldn't move nearly as much as it does--or, it wouldn't change its
motion nearly as much as it does when it's standing still. And so
mass--the inertial mass of the thing varies depending on how fast it's
moving. So, that's an important question for understanding this. Let's
see--yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Let's say that you're on Earth. If you were to push
an object that's standing still versus an object in motion, you're
going to have the same affect on it?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> No, you're not going to have the
same effect on it, because if the object in motion is going to have a
little extra piece to its mass.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Okay, so it has a very small effect [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> A very, very small effect. In fact,
if you try this on the Earth itself, which is moving at 30 kilometers a
second, that effect is going to be 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>

<p>So, that's what we calculated before, where we--where was it? Yeah,
here it is. That's this purple part here. You calculate
<i>V</i><sup>2</sup> <i>/</i> <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>, that's
10<sup>-8</sup>. So, it's a difference if something moving even as fast
as 30 kilometers a second, which is pretty fast--this difference is
only going to be--actually, 1/2 of 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>. So, it's a
hard thing to see. Now, the place you can see this stuff is in particle
accelerators, because there, you can take sub-atomic particles and
accelerate them to very close to the speed of light. And then you see
these very dramatic effects. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So, if something's going at the speed of light, so
that the force you would need to stop it is infinite [inaudible]?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yes, yes, that's correct. You
cannot stop something that's going at the speed of light, because the
force you'd need to accelerate it, which could either be a--making it
faster or slower, would be infinite. But, that's why photons don't have
any rest mass at all. That statement that you made only applies to
something which has non-zero--greater than zero rest mass.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> And they never go?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> And they never go to the speed of
light, because you can't get them that fast. You'd need an infinite
amount of force to get it to go that fast. Photons are a different
story. And, of course, if you stop a photon, it disappears. Because if
it's going less than the speed of light, then it's got no energy,
because it's a finite gamma times zero rest mass. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What about all the weird, like, time stuff you
always hear about?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> The weird time stuff you always
hear about. Excellent. Yeah, okay. A couple of other Lorentz
transformations. Time is equal to gamma times time zero. This is time
dilation. The faster you go, the slower your clock works. This is the
origin of all that nice science fiction, where you get on a rocket
ship. You go close to the speed of light. You go somewhere. You turn
around. You come back. Your clocks are running slow, so, it only takes
a year in your time. And you come back and everybody--you know, a
hundred years have passed. All your friends are dead, and so forth. So,
that's a whole science fiction thing.</p>

<p>There's also length contraction. That looks like this. Take the pen.
Put it in motion. Make that motion at some substantial fraction, at the
speed of light, and it gets shorter. Amazing. We'll talk more about
this in a little while.</p>

<p>Yeah, these are--these things with the gammas in them, they're
collectively known as the Lorentz transformations. That's just a name.
And these are the ways in which basic properties--space, time,
mass--change with velocity. Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So with the equation, <i>M</i> =
<i>M</i><sub>0</sub> times gamma. <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> is the intrinsic
mass?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yes. No, no, no,
<i>M</i><sub>0</sub>--yes. Let me think. <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> is the
intrinsic mass. <i>M</i> is the inertial mass.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> That's a way of thinking about
it.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So, if something was traveling at a very small
speed, wouldn't it mean that <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> /
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> was close to zero?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Which means the inertial mass would be close to
zero?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> No. If it goes--so, you were right
up to the very end. Remember how this works.</p>

<p>γ = 1 / [(1 - <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;/
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>]</p>

<p>If <i>V</i> / <i>c</i> goes to zero, gamma goes to 1. And in that
case, the inertial mass is equal to the intrinsic mass. And, if it's
going faster, then the inertial mass is bigger than the intrinsic mass.
The intrinsic mass is usually referred to as the rest mass.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Well, then how did you get <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> /
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Ah. That's the second term of the
series expansion.</p>

<p>1 / [(1 - <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;/
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>] expands to be 1 + 1/2
<i>V</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;/ <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> plus other terms.
Here's the first term. That's the rest mass, because we're going to
multiply this by <i>M</i>. And this is then the kinetic energy divided
by <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So the [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> It's the second term.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] inertial mass can never be zero. It'll
just go closer to the front?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah, the rest mass doesn't change.
If <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> goes to zero, what
happens is, the kinetic energy goes to zero, which is exactly what you
want it to do. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How does--how is momentum conserved when something's
relativistic?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> How is momentum conserved when
something's relativistic? Excellent. There is an equation of
relativistic momentum. And it's that thing that's conserved, which is
different from <i>M</i> times <i>V</i>, because <i>V</i> behaves
differently and <i>M</i> behaves differently. And you can work out
exactly where all the gammas go in that, and I don't remember it off
the top of my head. But there is a quantity that is conserved, but it
doesn't look quite the same as the Newtonian quantity. In the limit
where the velocity is small, it reduces down. The first term of that
series is <i>M</i> times <i>V</i>. Yes sir?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> When you define mass by the equation force equals
mass times the acceleration, how, then, do you define force?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah, okay. So, this gets a little
bit circular, right? Okay. Force--you can define it either way. Force
is the thing that--force is the ability to do work. That's the
technical definition. Force: ability to do work. And then, work also
has a technical definition. The problem with these things is you kind
of do--if you just define them all around the circle, they do tend to
come back and bite themselves in the tail. I agree with that.</p>

<p>But force is also related to energy. How much energy is required to
exert a certain force? So, all these things, interrelate--but it is
definitely true that there's a circularity to the definitions, if you
follow them all the way around. So, if you keep asking that kind of
question, I'm going to go around until I get back where I started from.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Why is the speed of light constant in all
frames?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Why is the speed of light constant
in all frames of reference? That's problem two of your problem set, and
I'll come--I'll say a few things--that's an insufficient answer, but
I'll come back and say a little bit more about that in a minute.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> We were just a little bit confused with the original
Lorentz transformation--how, in most cases, that transforms to <i>E</i>
= <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i>. Could you show that to us?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah. So, let's go back and take
another look at that. All right, so, here's what I'm going to do. First
of all, I'm going to take gamma--this quantity--and I'm going to expand
it. This is equal to gamma, and now I'm going to expand it. That gives
me 1 + 1/2 <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;/ <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. Let's see
what have I done with the--my--the pieces of paper are getting out of
order, here. Here it is.</p>

<p>So, inertial mass is equal to the rest mass, times gamma. So, now,
I'm going to substitute in this approximation for gamma. And then, I'm
going to multiply <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> through both terms. So this
is--so, the inertial mass is equal to the Newtonian mass, plus a term
that looks like this. One half <i>M</i> <i>V</i> squared is, in
Newtonian terms, the kinetic energy. And it appears here, divided by
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. And so, a way you can write this is that the
inertial mass is equal to the rest mass, plus the kinetic energy,
divided by <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. And that is an example of the fact
that energy divided by <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> is another way of
expressing mass.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Then, how is it not saying that energy over
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> equals--why is it not from the energy of
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, literally, algebraically, whether it be <i>M</i>
minus <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh, which <i>M</i> are you talking
about?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah, its <i>M</i><sub>0</sub>
here, and it's <i>M</i>&nbsp;over here. And so, somebody
asked--actually you're now the second person who's asked this question,
so I better answer it explicitly. I answered the question, "What is
mass?"</p>

<p>What's energy? <i>E</i> = <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i> squared. So, what do
I mean by this? <i>M</i>--this is the inertial mass. So, that's
<i>M</i>, which is equal to, in this case, <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> plus
kinetic energy over <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. And notice the difference
here. This is one kind of energy. This is kinetic energy. That's the
energy in--that's the energy contained in the motion.</p>

<p>Another way you could write this is the rest energy over
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. So <i>E</i>, here, is the total energy. And there
are two kinds of energies being expressed here. There's a rest energy,
divided by <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, and there's a kinetic energy, divided
by <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. But in the Newtonian case, you think of them
as two completely different things--whereas, in the relativistic case,
they're two manifestations of the same thing, and they add to make the
inertial mass. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> At what velocity are a fractions of <i>c</i>-- would
something need to be traveling on Earth for us to--for there to be a
perceptible relativistic effect?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Okay. So, how fast do you have to
go to have a perceptible relativistic effect? That depends how good
your instruments are. If you've got something that can perceive--that
can measure a velocity or an energy or a mass to eight decimal places,
then it doesn't have to go so fast. If you have something that's fairly
crude, then it has to go much faster.</p>

<p>But I should say--special relativity, these Lorentz transformations,
have been measured upside down and backwards in the laboratory. This
work to many, many decimal places.</p>

<p>Here's an example. If you take sub-atomic particles that are
unstable, that decay--they have a half life, so, half of them will
decay in ten seconds, or something. And you take those particles, and
you accelerate them to a large fraction of the speed of light. It takes
much longer for them to decay, because they're going so fast and their
time clocks slow down.</p>

<p>One manifestation of this is, there's a kind of unstable particle
that's created at the top of the atmosphere. These things are called
"muons." What happens is, cosmic rays come in. They blast the top of
the atmosphere. They make these muon things. The muons propagate close
to the speed of light, and they arrive at Earth. And you can measure,
if you have a little muon detector--never mind what the heck a muon
is--but imagine that you have something that could detect it on Earth,
and you see a whole bunch of these things caused by cosmic rays. But,
if you ask, how long did it take them to get from the top of the
atmosphere down to where your muon detector is, it's much, much longer
than their decay time. So, you really shouldn't see any of them at all.
But you do see them. And the reason is because they're going at close
to the speed of light. And so this is--these effects are observed and
measured to great accuracy in the laboratory and in astrophysical
situations. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I know it's practically impossible, but what would
happen here if we--if you were to go faster than the speed of
light?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Faster than the speed of light?
Well, you'd have super infinite mass. This would not be good. Well,
okay. So, let us imagine what the equations would do. What would happen
is, as you go faster than the speed of light, if you try and slow down
toward the speed of light, you'd have the same problem. That is to say,
it would take you more and more effort to slow down to close to the
speed of light. And the consequence of this is that if you're faster
than the speed of light, you can't slow down to the speed of light, or
slower than that.</p>

<p>There are hypothetical particles--and this doesn't exist in the real
world--but, there are hypothetical particles that do this. These are
called tachyons. They have the odd effect that they go backwards in
time--because again, if you believe the equations, right? Time
dilation. <i>T</i>&nbsp;= γ <i>T</i><sub>0</sub>. Now, look at gamma.
Square root of 1 - <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. So,
this is awkward. If <i>V</i> is bigger than <i>c</i>, this is a square
root of a negative number. That becomes imaginary. Right? Square root
of a negative number--hard to do. So, this becomes imaginary. So, your
time axis becomes imaginary, and all sorts of very bad things start to
happen to you. Yeah, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So, as your mass increases with velocity, do you
just--does the particle or the entity have a greater gravitational
effect?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Does it have a greater
gravitational effect? Excellent question. That's the next lecture,
because that's general relativity. And what you're doing is you're
assuming that Newtonian gravity is correct. Newtonian gravity--gravity
is a force proportional to the mass.</p>

<p>Turns out--and this is one of the things that led Einstein to his
theory of general relativity--turns out that relativistically,
it's--that gravity should not be thought of as a force, at all. And
there's a whole different way of thinking about it, and your question
has to be, in a kind of Zen sense, unasked. We'll get to that. We will
get to that. But the point is that, in relativistic theory, gravity is
not a force, anymore. And so, the question doesn't arise in quite the
same way. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible.]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Sorry?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> <i>E</i> = <i>M</i><sub>0</sub> /
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>&nbsp;+ <i>K.E</i>. Yeah. You have to put--you have
to get the <i>c</i> squareds in the right place, and that's basically a
unit conversion.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What's <i>K.E.</i> / <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> No, <i>E</i> -</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Oh, <i>E</i>.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> - is equal to <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>
<i>M</i><sub>0</sub> + <i>K.E</i>. Basically, what I've done is I've
multiplied this equation by <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> on both sides. Yeah.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I don't know if this is really a worthwhile
question, but, what is--what are the implications for, like, what time
is?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Well, this is the--</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> If you have one meaning of what time is?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Right. So, what are the
implications for what time is? This is the big stumbling block, from a
philosophical point of view, to all of this stuff.</p>

<p>Turns out, time isn't absolute. That is to say, one has the feeling,
as we go through our everyday life, that, you know, my watch and your
watch are kind of measuring more or less the same thing, to the extent
that they're accurate to do so. So, if we have identical, perfectly
accurate watches, and we go about our daily life and come back, they're
going to read the same time at the end if they read the same time at
the beginning--because time moves the same way for me as it does for
you. This turns out to be false.</p>

<p>And so, time is not an absolute quantity. Neither is space, for that
matter, because length changes also. This is quite disturbing. And the
reason it's so disturbing to us is our brains have evolved in a
situation where we're always moving really, really slowly compared to
the speed of light. And therefore, you don't have to worry about this
stuff in everyday life, down to some factor of 10<sup>-12</sup>. But,
nevertheless, it turns out to be true that time does not tick off in an
absolute way. And this is why people get so freaked out by this
stuff--because it seems counter to everyday experience. But, it can be
measured. And it turns out to be true.</p>

<p>So, the Newtonian case, what we're used to and the way our brains
work, turns out to be only an approximation of the way things really
are. There are other things that are conserved, no matter how fast you
go. And we can get to that at some point--but time isn't one of them.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Why is the speed of light this magic number?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Why is the speed of light this
magic number? Okay. So, the fact that there is a magic number comes out
of this kind of equation. Because, when this quantity is equal to 1,
bad things start to happen, and all the equations blow up. The fact
that it is the speed of light that happens to be that, in that
equation, is because light consists of particles with zero rest mass.
And a particle at zero rest mass has to have this thing go to infinity
or it doesn't exist at all.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Why is the world this way?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Well [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> That I--no, seriously, that's what
you're asking, and it's a good question, and I can't answer it. You
know, because this is where physics turns into--seriously, this is
where physics turns into theology. You can't--all you can say from
science is that this is the way it works. You can't answer the "why"
question. You got to talk to my colleagues in some other department
about that one. I'm sorry, because it's the question one would really
like to know the answer to, right? But that one I can't cope with.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Thinking about black holes, when the light enters
the black hole across the event horizon, I've heard that it often times
orbits or may orbit Jupiter? How is that possible if the light doesn't
have mass?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Okay, so, the question is, can
light go into orbit around a black hole? Basically. And the answer is,
yes it can. And then, the next part of the question was, how does that
work if it doesn't have any mass? You're asking the same question he
did over there, because what keeps it in orbit is gravity. And if you
reject the view that gravity is a force, then that question doesn't
become important. And we'll--as I say, we'll talk about that later. So,
that, again, is a question that pops up because you're thinking of
gravity as a force.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How does--with that equation, not to say "why," if
it is, why it is, but where--how is it derived?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> How is it derived? Okay. So, let me
go on with the presentation in the last couple of minutes of the class,
here. Here's--so, let me ask your question in a different way. Here's
what--why did Einstein think this up? What a crazy-ass thing to do,
right? Why not--there's little discrepancies when things are moving at
the--at high speeds, but who the heck cares? It's hard to measure
things at high speeds. Why not just stick with Newton, which has done
very well for two-and-a-half centuries?</p>

<p>Here was the problem. In the late nineteenth century, there were a
whole series of experiments, all of which, one way or another, had the
same consequence--namely, that light--the speed of light is the same in
all--for all observers. Okay? That's extraordinarily weird. It's not
obvious immediately why that's so weird. But let me try and explain
it.</p>

<p>Here's a guy, and let's say he's a baseball pitcher, and he's
throwing a ball. So, here's the ball and it's moving this way at some
velocity, which we'll call <i>V</i><sub>1</sub>. And you're down here,
or over here somewhere, it doesn't really matter. You're down here, and
you've got a radar gun, and you measure the velocity of that baseball.
How fast is it going? Well, if he throws it at <i>V</i><sub>1</sub>,
and you're at rest with respect to him, then you measure
<i>V</i><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>Now, supposing we put our pitcher on top of a moving train, all
right? And the train is moving at some other velocity,
<i>V</i><sub>2</sub>. So, the guy's on top of the train. He throws it
100 miles an hour. The train's moving at 100 miles an hour. You're
standing next to the track with your radar gun. How fast do you measure
that baseball to move? Well, you measure a total velocity, which is the
sum of the velocity of the baseball with respect to the train, and the
train with respect to you. Okay? That seems pretty clear.</p>

<p>But now, supposing this guy--instead of throwing a baseball, he's
got a flashlight. So he's got some light source, and the light is
moving at the speed of light, because that's the speed that light
moves. And you've got some device, down here, which measures how fast
that light moves along. And he's standing at rest with you. And you
measure the speed of light, and it comes out to be <i>c</i>--not
surprisingly, the same speed of light.</p>

<p>Now, let's put the guy on the train. Here he is, moving at
<i>V</i><sub>2</sub>, or any <i>V</i>. You would expect that the speed
of light that this guy measures down here would be <i>c</i>&nbsp;+
<i>V</i><sub>2</sub>. Right? Because, it would the speed of light with
respect--from the flashlight, with respect to the train, plus the speed
of the train, with respect to you. You would expect it to be <i>c</i>
plus <i>V</i><sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>But it isn't. It's <i>c</i>. <i>V</i><sub>total</sub> = <i>c</i>,
not <i>c</i> + <i>V</i><sub>2</sub>. Very weird. The speed of light is
the same no matter how fast you're moving relative to the source. You
could be moving at 99% of the speed of light, toward a light source,
and it would not be coming at you at 1.99 times the speed of light. It
would be coming towards you at the speed of light. You could have a
friend who's standing still, and you would both measure the same speed
of that light, even though you're moving really fast compared to your
friend. Very strange. And there are a whole series of experiments, the
most famous of which is something called the Michelson-Morley
experiment, which, one way or another demonstrated that this was the
case.</p>

<p>What to do? And, what Einstein did was, he said, hmmm. Okay, various
things were tried. The experiments were wrong. The equations were
slightly screwy, who knows. But Einstein took--Einstein's great genius
was to take this seriously, and to say, okay something is really
screwed up with velocities. What is velocity? Velocity is space over
time--miles per hour. Therefore--so, space and time are messed up when
you get close to the speed of light. Now, of course, it also has to be
true that when you're going slowly, the original Newtonian result is
recovered.</p>

<p>So, this is your problem set. I have written down the relativistic
formula for the addition of velocities. And your problem set is going
to be to use that series expansion to demonstrate that in the Newtonian
limits, you get this. And in the limit where one or the other of those
velocities is the speed of light, you get this. So, you'll see. The
algebra's actually not so bad. And that's what prompted Einstein to go
on this whole rampage, generating all of these gammas, and so forth. It
was the experimental evidence that there's a serious problem with
velocities. Okay, we got to stop. More next time.</p>
