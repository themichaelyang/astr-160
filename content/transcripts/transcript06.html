<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> You'll recall that where we got to
last time is that there are lots of Hot Jupiters; lots of Hot Jupiters.
And the alternative theories that were presented to explain the
evidence for Hot Jupiters--the evidence for Hot Jupiters comes in this
form of these velocity curves, where you plot the radial velocity
versus time of the star. And the star goes back and forth, and you
infer from that that there must be a planet going around it, which is
pulling the star back and forth. And some alternative explanations were
proposed to explain these kinds of data. Those alternative explanations
didn't seem to work very well, and so you have to kind of take the Hot
Jupiters seriously.</p>

<p>Before I go on, let me mention that, by now, Hot Jupiters are not
the only kind of planets that have been seen this way. There are also
planets in--now known to have much longer orbits, up to a few years.
These are harder to see for two reasons. First of all, it takes you a
few years to see them. And second of all, when the orbits get longer,
the velocities that they induce go down, because things in long orbits
go slowly. But, nevertheless, now we've been able to see a bunch of
things.</p>

<p>Oddly, in many cases, they turn out to have highly elliptical
orbits, in some cases. Not the Hot Jupiters, not the ones that are
close in. Those all are more or less circular. But some of these longer
ones have highly elliptical orbits. That's also very weird in terms of
our theories of planetary formation because one of the things that our
theories were designed to explain was the fact that all the major
planets in our own Solar System have orbits that are close to circular.
It does a very good job of explaining that and then, naturally enough,
has trouble explaining the ones we see that are in highly elliptical
orbits--highly elliptical--yes, I didn't--highly elliptical orbits, in
some cases. And just so you know, the way you recognize a highly
elliptical orbit is it's not sinusoidal anymore. It's got some other
shape. So, these come in: periodic but non-sinusoidal velocity
curves.</p>

<p>So, all this is very amusing and you pile up all these very strange
kinds of planets, or what you think are planets. But there's still sort
of the nagging question of whether these radial velocity curves might
be explainable in some other way. And it would be awfully nice to have
evidence of some other kind for the existence of these planets.</p>

<p>This is, you know, what happens in science. You find some kind of
fairly strong evidence for something, but it would be way stronger if
you found two different kinds of evidence. Different--collected in
different ways or reflecting different aspects of what you're observing
that both point in the same direction.</p>

<p>And, at a certain point along the way, about six years ago or so, a
new kind of evidence for the existence of these planets was discovered.
And the first such case, which is now a very famous star for this
reason, was something called HD209458; that's the name of the star. And
this was a Hot Jupiter system. So, this is the name of the star; Hot
Jupiter was discovered in the usual way by Doppler measurements, by
radial velocity measurements.</p>

<p>And then, something else was discovered. So, let me show what they
found in this system. All right, so let me explain what's plotted here.
This is the brightness of this system, not the radial velocity this
time--the brightness against time. And so, here it is on the 9th of
September, 1999. And somebody is measuring the brightness of this
thing. And it's set up in units so that the average brightness is 1.
And you can see, these measurements have a little bit of error in them.
They scatter around. And then, at a certain point there's a dip in the
brightness of the star for a few hours; notice this is in days. This is
a tenth of a day, so 2.4 hours, something like that. So, for a few
hours the brightness of this thing dips down to about 98% of its--of
the brightness it has, so 2--it loses 2% of its brightness for a little
while and then it comes back up.</p>

<p>And then, interestingly enough, seven nights later on the night of
the 16th of September, it did the same thing. Now, seven nights is an
important number for this particular system, because it turns out that
the orbital period of its Hot Jupiter, which was already known at the
time, is three and a half days. So, this is exactly two orbits later.
The exact same dip occurred. You couldn't see it one orbit later
because three and a half days later it's daytime, and one of the
features of astronomy is that you do it at night. And so you have to
wait two day--two orbits to see the same thing again.</p>

<p>So, every orbit--there appears to be this little dip. And what is
happening is that this is a system that's almost exactly edge-on. And
what's happening is that the planet is passing in front of the star,
and once per orbit the planet gets in the way of the star. The planet's
this little thing, the star's a big thing. And a small amount of the
star's light is obscured by the planet. This is called a transit. So,
let me just write that down. And then, transits are discovered--yeah,
okay, we'll come back to the overheads in a minute because I want to
show you more plots. And it's the planet getting in the way of the
starlight. And what this tells you, also, is how big the planet is,
because you've got a little disc in front of a big disc. And the amount
of light that's obscured--this 2%--tells you what the ratio of the area
projected by the planet, compared to the area projected by the entire
star, is.</p>

<p>So, this gives you an additional piece of information. You already
know the mass of the thing because you've measured the radial velocity.
Now, we also know its size. So, this was very interesting. And it is,
as I was saying just a second ago, an entirely different kind of
confirmation of the existence of this planet. So, there's no pulsation
going on here, because some--you not only are getting the changes in
velocity of the planet you're seeing--of the star, you're also seeing
the light of the star diminish when the planet passes in front of
it.</p>

<p>And then, so, they decided this was interesting, and so they did
this same experiment, except with this Hubble Space Telescope instead
of with some ground-based telescope. This is what you see with Hubble,
and you can see why Hubble is a better telescope than the ground-based
stuff. This is exactly the same plot. This is the average brightness of
the system outside of the transit, so this is 1.000. This is .985 so
it's dropped down 1.5% in brightness. This is in days and in--this is a
tenth of a day here, each of these big ticks is .05 of a day. And here
is the star going along perfectly normally. And you get better
measurements because you're not distorted by the atmosphere. And then,
all of a sudden, the thing drops and it gets--has this very particular
shape to the light curve, to the curve of brightness with time.</p>

<p>This shape is perfectly explained by the hypothesis that you're
passing an opaque disc across the surface of the star. As the disc
touches the star it starts to--and gradually more and more of the disc
is over the star. You get this steep drop here. And then, this rounded
part down on the bottom comes about because when you look at a star,
the center of the star, the central portion of the star looks a little
bit brighter than the edges because, if you think about looking at a
sphere, if you look at the center, you're looking right at it. If
you're looking at the side, you're sort of grazing the edge and it
turns out there is something called "limb darkening," which comes about
because of this. So, stars, if you look at the Sun for example, the
edges of the Sun look a little fainter than the middle. And so, what
happens is, as this disc passes across the face of the star, it
obscures successively brighter parts of the star until you get down to
here. Then, it obscures gradually fainter parts of the star until it
gets to the edge. Now, the disc is--as it goes up here, is passing
beyond the edge of the star.</p>

<p>So, this is exactly the shape of a light curve you would predict if
you passed an opaque disc in front of a star. And it really works out
remarkably well. In fact, there's a line underneath these points, you
can see it off here and off here, which is a prediction. And you can't
see the line because it's under the point so nicely. So, this works out
incredibly well. This is almost for sure an opaque disc, namely the
planet, passing in front of the star.</p>

<p>So, transits are discovered--the dip in light due to planet passing
across the star. Now, this does not happen in every Hot Jupiter,
because you have to be lined up pretty, pretty perfectly in order for
the planet to pass in front of the star. That is to say if--here's you,
here's an observer, here's the star. And, if the planet--if the orbital
plane of the planet looks like this, then when the planet's in front of
the star, it'll be below it. So, if you think about it, imagine a
planet that's orbiting like this. Here's its star. And it never passes
in front of the star, because when it's in front of the star, it's
below the star. Whereas, if it--if it's exactly edge-on, then once per
orbit, it will pass in front of the star. But, you have to have a very
precise alignment for that to take place--so, requires a precisely
edge-on alignment. But, if you have such an alignment, you know how
these dips ought to line up with the radial velocity curve.</p>

<p>So, now what you see is, you measure the brightness of the star
versus time, and you see these dips. Here's a dip. Then one orbit
later, you get another dip, and so forth. If you then, at the same
time, measure the radial velocity--and again, this is the radial
velocity of the star--then you know how this has to take place. Because
here you are. You're looking at it. And the moment where the dip takes
place, the planet's got to be exactly in front of the star. That means
the planet is at this point in its orbit, going that way, for example,
and the star is in this part of its orbit, going that way--which means
this--the radial velocity at the moment the dip occurs has to be zero.
Because for them to be lined up, one in front of the other, they've
both got to be going sideways. And shortly before that, the star was
moving away from you, because they're moving into position, like this.
Shortly afterwards, the star is coming towards you. And, remember that
positive radial velocities are coming toward--or going away from you,
negative velocities are coming towards you. So it used to be--it used
to be going away from you, positive. It's now at zero at the point of
the dip. And then it's going to be coming towards you, so it has to be
that these dips take place at that point in the curve. And so, here
again, it's got to be like this. And so, the way this has to work out
is something like this. So, you can predict what the radial velocity
has to be at the particular moment where the transit occurs.</p>

<p>And so this works. This works for HD--what is it? 209458. So this
works out. So, now you've got a lot of evidence that this really is a
planet. Not only is it moving the star back and forth the way you
expect a planet to do, it's also passing in front of that star at
exactly the moment you expect it to pass in front of the star, and the
shape of the dip that it creates is exactly what you would expect if
you pass an opaque disc in front of a star. So now, you've got a whole
bunch of different kinds of evidence. You can ask, "Does this prove
it's a planet?"</p>

<p>And then you get into this problem with scientific proof. What does
it mean to prove something in science? You could probably figure out
some clever way that it's actually a pulsating star, which has a star
spot on it that somehow precisely mimics exactly the way a planet would
behave. Impossible that this would--well not--I should be careful with
that word. Highly improbably that this would actually occur in real
life, so I think, you know--people have the feeling that science is
truth, somehow, and that, you know, that you can prove things in
science, kind of, to a mathematical certainty.</p>

<p>That actually isn't the case. The legal standard, you know, which
you're familiar from cop shows, of beyond a reasonable doubt, applies
in science as well. And that's actually a more appropriate standard to
use for anything, which, in the law or in the natural world, in which
you try and reason by induction. And so I would say that this, plus
this, plus the shape of the--of the spectral lines, which we talked
about last time, plus the shape of these dips--that's proof way beyond
a reasonable doubt that there's a planet around this particular star.
And that really ended the conversation. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is it always directly edge-on or could there be a
case in which it's [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> --sort of like a little bit below or a little bit
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> So, is it always edge-on? Well,
orbits don't change, so for this object it's always edge-on. For most
objects, it is not edge-on, and so, in fact, what had happened was, by
the time they discovered this one, there were a couple of dozen of Hot
Jupiters known. None of the rest of them do this, because in all the
rest of them, the orbit isn't aligned properly, and so the planet never
goes in front of the star. And so, in the vast majority of cases, you
don't get this. And so, they only discovered this after they'd found so
many of them, that one of them turned out to be aligned properly, you
know, just by chance.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is there--it possible for an orbit to not--never
pass in front of the center of the star?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> No. What it does is it passes--it's
got to do this, it's got to have some moment where the planet is as far
towards you as it can be, and then it turns around and comes back. But
for most orbits, at that point, the planet will either be below or
above the star from your line of sight. So, imagine this orbit as the
planet goes--here's a star. Planet's going around the star. It reaches
its furthest forward point, but it's well below the star from your line
of sight. So, it depends on the angle of the orbital plane. Does that
make sense?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: It, it doesn't have to pass through the center of
the star, it could pass [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh, oh --</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible.]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yes, sorry, exactly right. It
doesn't have to pass through the center of the star. It can graze the
tip at the bottom of the star a little bit. And in fact, in this
object, you can tell how close to the center it goes by the exact shape
of the curvature down at the bottom of that light curve. Because, you
know what the expected distribution of brightness across the face of
the star is. You also know something about the radius of the star. This
is supposed to be a solar-type star, presumably has a radius of the
Sun. If it passes across, sort of grazes the bottom, then the dip will
be shorter, because it will pass through faster. And so, you can figure
out exactly what the trajectory across the thing is. Most of the time
it misses. And in this case, you can figure out that the angle of the
inclination, so-called, which is 90 degrees if it's exactly edge-on, is
80--I think 88 point something, I don't remember the answer. Because,
it doesn't go exactly across the center, it goes, sort of, sort of
halfway down.</p>

<p>So yeah, that actually gives you additional information. How long
the dip is and what the exact shape of the thing, tells you which part
of the star it passes across. Yes good, thanks Bethany. Other questions
about this? Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Have we ever discovered a planet through transit
without having discovered it previously?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Right, have we discovered a planet
through transit without having discovered the previous radial velocity
curves? Yes, and we'll get to that. Because, let me just say this: as
soon as this was discovered, people got way excited, because it's quite
difficult to make these kinds of precise radial velocity measurements.
You have to have very specialized equipment. Only a few people in the
world can do it. There's this bunch of people in California who can do
it. There's this bunch of people in Switzerland who can do it.</p>

<p>Us – normal astronomers, don't have that kind of expertise and
equipment, but measuring a change in brightness of a star by 2%, that's
easy. I can do it up on Science Hill [an area of the Yale campus where
the Astronomy Department is located] in our little observatory up
there. In fact, I have done it for this star. You can--if the timing
were better, this star is up in the summertime, unfortunately. If it
were up in the fall we would have this be an exercise in Astro&nbsp;155
[a Yale Astronomy class], because it's entirely straightforward to go
and measure a 2% difference in brightness in a star. Anybody, you know,
with 2,000 bucks' worth of equipment, you can go out into your backyard
and do this experiment. This is a big deal.</p>

<p>So, as soon as that was possible, everybody got fired up, you know,
"I'm going to play this game myself." And we all laid very elaborate
plans for going out and finding zillions of planets. And the problem is
that it has to be exactly aligned edge-on for this to even occur. And
so, most stars with planets--this doesn't happen. And so, you would
have to observe many, many, many stars in order to see this one time.
So you have to--while it's easy to do for any one particular object,
it's hard to discover them this way because you have to do it in bulk.
You have to look at many stars at once.</p>

<p>So then, people thought, well, great, we know how to do this. We'll
look at many stars at once. We'll take pictures of star clusters,
of--where there are lots and lots of stars. And we'll just keep taking
pictures of these star clusters over and over again. You'll look at
30,000 stars at a time, and if one of them has a dip, we'll find that
dip. And so, the way we'll deal with the fact that this doesn't always
occur is by looking at star clusters. And so, they tried this, again,
with the space telescope, because it works better at doing this kind of
thing.</p>

<p>The problem with star clusters is that the stars are really close to
each other, so from the ground it just looks like a mush. In this case,
you have to see the stars separately. So, they took a particular star
cluster--also the advantage of doing it from space is no daytime, and
so, you can observe continuously. So, they took eight consecutive days
of Hubble Space Telescope time and did nothing but look at a star
cluster, a cluster called--famous cluster called 47 Tuc, 37 stars. They
took repeated images of this star cluster, and they figured, we ought
to see some number of planets by the transit method, first, in this
cluster.</p>

<p>So just, here's what the cluster looks like. So this, on the left,
is a ground-based picture of this cluster, and you can see what the
problem with observing this stuff from the ground is. If you look down
in the middle, it's all mushed together. You wouldn't be able to pick
out individual stars. But then, this box here, blown up to the
right-hand side of the picture--this is what that little box looks like
from the Hubble Space Telescope. And now, you have the resolution to
observe each of these stars, or many of them individually. And so they
took eight nights of Hubble Space Telescope time--that's a lot of time
on the space telescope. The space telescope costs about a $1,000,000 a
day to run. And so, this is 8,000,000 bucks' worth of observing
time.</p>

<p>Okay, so what did they expect to see? So, finding planets directly
from transits. And so, they observe a cluster of stars--30,000 stars at
a time. So, what do you expect? Well, it turns out, from the radial
velocity studies, they had gone and looked at a lot of, sort of,
Sun-like stars. So, 30,000 more or less Sun-like stars, I should
specify, from the radial velocity measurements from the Doppler
measurements. They got answers like approximately 1 out of 10
stars--this is a rough estimate – have Hot Jupiters. And then, how
precisely aligned do they have to be? Approximately 1&nbsp;out of 100
Hot Jupiters is aligned properly to get a transit.</p>

<p>And so, now, you have a prediction. You look at 30,000 stars. A
tenth of them have planets, that's 3,000 planets. One hundredth of
those will be aligned up in such a way that you can see a transit.
That's thirty&nbsp;transits. Predict-- thirty transits. And it was that
kind of calculation--this is just a rough estimate, but they had done
this much more precisely. It was that kind of estimate that persuaded
the people at the Space Telescope Institute to allocate all these many
hours of space telescope time to this project.</p>

<p>The result was zero transits, none. Not seen. And this was a little
distressing, except it didn't take people very long to figure out that
they should have known this in advance. And this is--you know, you get
a result and then of course people--you get an unexpected result, and
then people start writing papers which say, well, of course that's what
you should have gotten. Any fool could have predicted that you would
not see any transits in a star cluster, except none of the fools
did.</p>

<p>Let's see, so--but, in retrospect, it was clear that this wasn't
going to give you the thing you thought because of two factors. First,
in--why? So, first factor: in clusters, the stars are really close
together. Stars--they sometimes collide or more often have near
collisions. And when a star comes cruising into your planetary system,
the star has a lot of gravity. It's going to completely wreck the
orbits of the planets because you're going to have the gravity of a
second star. And it turns out that what this does is it liberates the
planets. And so, it will disrupt planetary orbits. So, you kind of
don't expect there to be any planet; you expect there to be planets in
the cluster, but they'll be free floating planets sort of wandering
around the cluster, because they will have been detached from their
parent star by incoming stars--by close encounters with other stars in
the cluster.</p>

<p>Put it this way. The nearest star to the Sun, beside the Sun, Alpha
Cen, is about a parsec away. In a cubic parsec, at the center of one of
these clusters, there are a million stars. And so, there are a million
stars packed into the space where only one star exists in our corner of
the galaxy. So, they run around--you know, if you were in a cluster, if
you were in a planet on a cluster, and you were looking up at the sky,
the constellations would change from year to year, because the stars
are so nearby that their motions would be readily apparent. And once
every few hundred million years, a star would come cruising into your
Solar System and detach all of the planets from the star. And so, you
don't expect there to be any planets.</p>

<p>You also don't expect there to be any planets for an entirely
different reason, which is, one of the things that had been discovered
as they were piling up all these Hot Jupiters found by the Doppler
Shift method, is that stars are more likely to have planets--have
planets--if they have high amounts of heavy elements--heavy elements.
Now, let me explain that. Most stars--stars are mostly hydrogen and
helium. Astronomers do chemistry in a very peculiar way. We have--we
consider there are three kinds of things in the universe. There's
hydrogen, there's helium, and there's metal. Chemists--everything else
is a metal. If don't care if it's oxygen, carbon, whatever. The
chemists get really uncomfortable with this. But, you know, it's like
the supposed primitive tribes. I'm not sure these--this actually
exists, but the linguists say there are tribes in the world where they
count one, two and many. Well, this is how astrono--I don't know if
such tribes exist except for the astronomers, who really do. And we
count, one, two, and many. And we call any chemical element heavier
than helium a metal.</p>

<p>So, we have this concept called metallicity, which is defined to be
the fraction of something of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium,
which are the first two in the Periodic Table, as you probably know.
So, everything else is a metal. The metallicity of the Sun--Sun's
metallicity--is about 2%. And the metallicity of the Solar System is
therefore about 2%, because the Sun's got all the mass. And, high
metallicity stars, by which I mean, metallicities greater than the
Sun--greater than solar--are more likely to have planets.</p>

<p>This makes perfect sense. This is the first thing in a little while
that's made any sense--because, how do you make a planet? Well, planets
aren't made out of hydrogen and helium. Planets are made out of the
other stuff. We're made out of silicon and iron, and the--Jupiter's got
a lot of ice, and so all these kinds of heavy elements--you don't
make--you can't make a planet if all you've got is hydrogen and helium
because there's nothing solid to have it form. And the only way you get
to keep your hydrogen and helium, the 98% of the stuff that's hydrogen
and helium, is if you already have a big core of heavier--either rocks,
or ice, or something else--if you already have some metallic, in the
astronomical sense, core. And so this makes perfect sense. If you don't
have any metals, you can't be forming planets.</p>

<p>And star clusters of the kind that Hubble observe are known, and
this particular one is, to consist of low metallicity stars. In the
case of 47 Tuc, the one we looked at, it's--the metallicity of the
thing is, I think, about a fifth that of the Sun. So, it's got very
substantially fewer heavy elements. So, no planets.</p>

<p>So, in two different ways this was a mistake, right? But that was
only realized afterwards. And, it's unfortunate that it was a mistake
in two different ways. Because if it was a mistake in only one
different way you would have learned something from this, because you
would have confirmed the idea that a star--close stellar encounters
strip planets off of stars--except maybe it's only because of the low
metallicity. Or, you would have confirmed the idea that low metallicity
stars can't have planets; except in this case, maybe it's just because
of the stars and the planets have been stripped away. So it's kind of
unfortunate that there were two excellent explanations different from
each other about why you should have predicted this result before you
obtained it.</p>

<p>However, having done that, it was clear what the next experiment had
to be: that you wanted to go out and try and measure these transits in
some region that's a little less dense, and a whole lot more metal
rich. So, next experiment, which was done last summer, didn't look at a
star cluster. It looked at the center--a region close to the center of
the galaxy. So, this is lots of stars, but significantly less dense
than what you would get in the center of a cluster.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they had put up a bigger camera into the space
telescope since then, so you could cover more of the sky, which was
useful. This is the camera; by the way, you may have read, over the
weekend, that Hubble's had a little bit of a problem. The electronics
in this wide field camera have shorted out. And so, Hubble's kind of in
trouble for--until they get the next visit, because its major camera is
now blind. And this happened, I should say, 12 hours after the deadline
for submitting proposals. So, there had been almost 1,000 proposals
submitted from around the world, of which, maybe only a fifth would
ever get done. People in our department and basically every department
in the whole--astronomy department in the whole world were going nuts
trying to prepare their detailed proposals for using the thing. They
submitted them, and a few hours later it broke. And so, then there was
this nice little email from the people at the Space Telescope Institute
saying, "uhh, you might want to reconsider, and we've created a new
deadline three weeks from now so that you can revise and extend."</p>

<p>There are other instruments that still work but the cameras aren't
as good. And so, now, everybody's scratching their head and thinking,
can I actually do this, and if I can, what's the good strategy? Do I
want to try and do it now when the competition's going to be much less
because the instruments are lousy? Or, do I want to wait until after
September 2008, when they're scheduled to go up replace the camera and
repair the thing, and try and do it with the good instruments then,
when everybody else in the world is going to want to do their
experiment? And so, we're all grappling with this at the moment.</p>

<p>However, last summer this was working like crazy. And they did
another one of these ten consecutive days of observations, but this
time of the center of the galaxy, which has lots of stars--but less
dense than in the center of the cluster, and also has the advantage
that many of these stars, most of them, are high metallicity stars. So,
hopefully, this will work, right? Because you've eliminated both of the
excellent reasons why it didn't work the last time.</p>

<p>So, here is the field of view that they were looking at. This is a
tiny piece of the center of the galaxy. Lots and lots and lots of
stars, which is good, because you want to see them. And these little
circles here, which are numbered from 1 to 16, I believe, are circles
around little Sun-like stars. You can see the stars in the middle of
those circles; you probably have a hard time seeing. Let's turn the
lights down. This is kind of a nice picture. This is what the center of
the galaxy looks like to the Hubble Space Telescope. And these bright
things--the colors are sort of quasi-real. These things are red giant
stars and solar type stars. The center of the galaxy is quite far
away--are really quite faint, you can barely see it. See in the middle
of this circle there's a little star there, that's a Sun-like star in
the middle of the galaxy. And these circles are these stars in which
they found--in which they found transits. So, in this case, it worked.
So, it's true that one or the other or both of those reasons they had
why it didn't work in the star cluster, were in fact the reason it
didn't work in the star clusters. Because here's a situation where
those problems don't exist. And now they found sixteen of these things,
which is pretty close to the amount you would have expected.</p>

<p>And so now it is--these are planets, which have been discovered
first by the transit method. I should say, there are a couple of others
that have been discovered. First by the transit method, from people at
the ground just going out and looking at random stars. And in some of
those cases, they have been done the opposite thing, and gone back and
found the radial velocity measurements after having discovered the
tran--the planet by transits. You can't do radial velocity on these
guys because they're too faint, and it's just not going to work
out.</p>

<p>Okay, how're we doing? All right. Now, a couple of consequences of
this. If you have both radial velocity measurements, which tell you the
mass of the planet, and transits, which tell you the radius of the
planet, then you know something very important. You know the density.
Density--then, you get the density.</p>

<p>Density is usually written down with the Greek letter ρ, for some
reason, which I don't understand, but it's always done that way, so
we'll do it too. And density is defined as mass of something divided by
its volume. And so, for a spherical object, the volume--if you go back
to some geometry book, you can look this up. 4/3π times the radius
cubed, and that's the density.</p>

<p>The density, if you--the density of water is about--is 1 gram per
cubic centimeter. Now, of course, that's a lousy set of units. We do
things in kilograms per cubic meter. That's, as it turns out, 1,000
kilograms per cubic meter. So, if you picture a cubic meter, that's a
pretty huge aquarium. It's actually pretty heavy. And, let's see, is
this right? 10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;times a gram--yeah,
that's right. And, in fact, interestingly enough, this is the
definition of a gram. This is where they came up with that metric
unit--is to make it work out so that the density of water is one--is
exactly 1 gram per cubic centimeter. You have to specify the
temperature, too, because--but, so, that's a typical density of water,
which is on ice, right?</p>

<p>Rocks have higher density--much higher density. That's why a handful
of iron is heavier than an equivalent sized handful of snow, or
something like that. So, if you know the density, you can tell
something about the composition of the planet. And it turns out that
the Hot Jupiters, in the few cases we now have--it's not just one case,
it's several cases--Hot Jupiters have low density. They really are ice
balls. They're not made out of rock. And so, an idea you might have had
about where the Hot Jupiters come from is, well, in these high
metallicity stars, there's just a whole bunch more rock, and the
Earth-like planets kind of get big. But that isn't what happened. These
things really are made out of ice. And now you have a problem, because
you know how far away they are from the star. And the temperature of
these things--the surface temperature of these things is, like, 1,000
degrees. This is not a good place to put a snowball, all right? You put
a snowball in some place which is 1,000 degrees--we won't specify the
place--and something bad is going to happen to it.</p>

<p>Now, the--and so, therefore, how could these planets have formed?
And so the idea--the current thinking on this is an idea called
migration. And the idea behind migration is that you make Jupiters in
the Outer Solar System, where they belong. And then, through some
mechanism, which people have ideas about, but which aren't--isn't at
the moment really specified--these things, after they are formed, they
migrate into the Inner Solar System. And the reason this is a useful
thing to do is that a big thing melts slowly. The reason for that is
that the surface area to volume ratio is low. Volume goes up as the
cube of the radius--surface area, goes up--as the square. If you shine
a light on something, the amount of energy it picks up depends on how
big it is, not on how massive it is. And so, changes of temperature in
interacting with your environment are less, the bigger you are. This is
why, by the way, arctic animals tend to be big: because they're trying
to survive in an environment that's much colder than they are. And so,
they generate energy by their volume and they lose it out their skin,
by their surface area. So, you want to have a lot of volume compared to
your surface area. Big things melt slowly. So, you can't have ice
planetesimals in the Inner Solar System. But you can have something the
size of Jupiter. And it'll melt, but it'll take longer than the age of
the Solar System, or even the age of the universe, to do so.</p>

<p>So this is the idea. And of course, the key point here is this
migration. And there are ideas about why this should happen, but it
isn't wholly clear.</p>

<p>Now, one thing, a consequence of this idea, is that there are no
terrestrial planets. No terrestrial planets, because as this Jupiter is
moving inward, if there's an Earth in the way, it's going to either
knock it out of its orbit completely, or the Earth will run into
Jupiter and become incorporated into that planet. So, if you've got a
Jupiter-size system in--near where your Earth-like planet is orbiting,
that Earth-like planet's in big trouble for exactly the same reason the
planets are in trouble, in general, when another star comes through,
because you've got something much more massive coming by, screwing up
your orbit. So, there are no terrestrial planets. Their orbits are
disrupted by the migrating Jupiter.</p>

<p>Now, in fact, I have to qualify this a little. There was a paper
that showed up in the literature, a few months back, with some clever
way of preserving the terrestrial planets as the Jupiter came by. I
have to say, I don't fully appreciate the force of this argument. It is
perhaps true--because I haven't read the paper carefully enough, but I
feel obliged to mention that somebody, at least, has an idea about how
you can avoid it. But, in sort of straightforward terms, you don't
expect there to be terrestrial planets in a situation where a Jupiter
has migrated from the Outer Solar System to the Inner Solar System.
Questions? How are we doing? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I was just wondering what caused the Hot Jupiters to
migrate?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> What causes the Hot Jupiters to
migrate? This is a subject of some discussion among the experts. The
idea is that when the Jupiter forms, remember it forms out of a disc of
gas? There might still be a substantial residual gas and dust disc. And
as the Jupiter plows through it, the friction with that disc slows it
down. And if you slow down the orbit of a planet, it'll gradually fall
inwards. That's one idea.</p>

<p>There are some--there are other ideas. But it isn't clear. And if it
were clear, you would have predicted it to happen. And indeed, there's
a whole problem with the migration theory. So, problem with migration
is, sometimes it doesn't work. Because, Jupiter in our Solar System is
where Jupiter is. It didn't migrate. It has to work--needs--so, the
problem with the migration system is, it needs to work, but not always.
It also can't work too well, because if it works too well, then the
Jupiter falls right into the Sun, right? So, it has to work most of the
time, but not all the time, but not too well. This is a complicated
balancing act. And, whatever theory you propose, whether it's this
friction with a dust disc, or anything else, you've got a little
problem with this whole concept. Because you have to tune this
mechanism up so that it takes most Jupiters, moves them into the Inner
Solar System, and then stops working at just the right point to leave
you with a whole bunch of Hot Jupiters, most but not all of the
time.</p>

<p>All right, that's as much as we know about it. That's--you know, you
got to come back three years from now and see if we've straightened
this out, because that's where we are at the moment. All right, more
later.</p>
