<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Okay, this is the last class of the
section on black holes and relativity. I should say, this particular
section of the course has gone in a direction I didn't quite expect.
We've done a little more--gone a little more deeply into the theory. We
haven't done quite as much on actual observed objects. That's not such
a terrible thing. I'm quite happy with that. I just want to point out a
couple of things that were on the syllabus that we didn't get to,
because they're very interesting things. You can look them up on the
little black hole website and find out all sorts of things about
them.</p>

<p>And one of them is, there exists a category of what's called
supermassive black holes. I mentioned the black holes that come from
stars, and I'll talk about that much more today. But I don't think I'm
going to have a chance to talk about the supermassive black holes.
These are black holes that live in the centers of galaxies and can have
masses of hundreds of thousands, millions, sometimes even billions of
times the mass of the Sun. So, very massive black holes in the centers
of galaxies--including our own galaxy, by the way.</p>

<p>And it is gas falling into these black holes that powers the
quasars. We saw a gravitationally lensed quasar the other day. These
are very powerful sources of emission that are located in the centers
of galaxies, sometimes called active galactic nuclei, and they're
caused by these very massive black holes. So, that's one thing we're
probably not going to get to.</p>

<p>Another thing is, I had originally intended to talk a little bit
about gravitational waves. I mentioned that in the context of the fact
that the emission of these waves causes the orbital periods of things
like the binary pulsar, and indeed all orbits, in principle, to
gradually becomes shorter. The orbital period, the semi-major axis,
gradually becomes shorter. But there's also the hope--it hasn't yet
been done--that you could detect these waves directly, that you could
make a kind of telescope that would actually observe gravitational
waves. This is now in progress. It hasn't yet succeeded. So, these can,
in principle, be directly detected. That hasn't been done yet, but it
will be soon, I think.</p>

<p>There's something called the Laser Interferometer Gravity
Observatory, abbreviated LIGO, which is basically a kilometer-long hunk
of metal, the length of which can be measured to some fraction of the
size of an atom. And when a gravitational wave rolls over this, what
you expect to happen is you should see the thing getting slightly
longer and slightly shorter as the wave goes over it. The problem with
this is that the effect of passing trucks on highways ten miles away is
many, many times greater than the effect of passing gravitational
waves. And so, what they've done is they've built two of these things,
one in Washington State and one in Louisiana. And the plan is to
operate them simultaneously, so that you can see, things that happen in
both places might be attributable to some cosmic source.</p>

<p>There's a whole bunch of other stuff to talk about this. It's a
fabulous experiment, and as I say, we probably won't get a chance to
talk about it in detail. But you can go to the black hole website, and
that has links to all sorts of other things. And you may--if they
succeed in this, somebody's winning the Nobel Prize, and so, you may
find out about it by reading it in the paper five years from now, or
so. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So--I'm sorry--you mentioned supermassive black
holes. Have you ever directly observed them?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Have we ever directly observed a
supermassive black hole? It depends what you mean by "directly
observe." By definition, you can't directly observe a black hole. We
infer their presence in almost exactly the same way that we infer the
presence of the small black holes, which I'm going to talk about now;
namely, by watching things orbit around them. And so, basically what
you--for example, in the center of our own galaxy, there's a one--I
think 1 million, 3 million, I don't remember, some number of millions
of solar masses of stuff right at the center of the galaxy. You can
tell that because the orbits of the stars closest in, which emits no
radiation at all. And so, there's something down there that's extremely
massive and totally dark. And we know that that's true by watching the
orbits of nearby stars.</p>

<p>And we can actually carry out this same kind of observation in the
centers of other galaxies. And as far as we can tell, there's one of
these supermassive black holes in the middle of every significant
galaxy. And that's actually been one of the achievements of this kind
of astronomy over the past dozen years, or so--is to demonstrate in
each case, for which we have enough data, there seems to be an
extremely massive invisible something, down in the middle of these
things. And there are other reasons to think that they're actually
black holes, rather than, you know, a hundred million neutron stars, or
something silly like that. And so, we're pretty much convinced, by now,
that these things live in the centers of galaxies, and we're quite
convinced that there's one in the middle of our own galaxy. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Why are they in the middle of all the galaxies?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Why are they in the middle of all
the galaxies? This is actually a little bit of a mystery. How these
things get made is not clear. It's pretty clear how the stellar mass,
the ten solar mass ones, get made. It's the collapse of a single star.
How these things build up, how they grow, where they came from in the
first place, is a little less clear than it is for the stellar mass
thing.</p>

<p>There is recent work which suggests that the very first generation
of stars was quite massive, thousands of solar masses, rather than
stars of one solar mass, or something like that. And maybe this first
generation of stars collapsed down into thousand mass black holes, and
then a whole bunch of them ran into each other and fell into the
centers of galaxies. But I would have to say that it isn't entirely
clear where these supermassive things come from. In contrast to the
situation with ten solar mass black holes, where we have, if not a
detailed theory, at least, a good handle on the broad story of where
they come from.</p>

<p>Okay. So, that's what we're not going to talk about. So, now, let me
talk about what we are going to talk about. Sort of a meta-lecture, I
guess. Let's see, last time I talked about the Binary Pulsar. And that
was an example of a very detailed test of post-Newtonian relativity.
And what I want to talk about now is strong-field relativity.
Relativistic effects that have nothing to do with Newtonian theory,
that are totally different, and then, happen when you're really, very
close to an event horizon, or in some other kind of drastic
situation.</p>

<p>So, here's the plan, here's how you would--how would you go about
testing the predictions of strong-field relativity? Well, the first
thing you'd want to do is find a black hole. Not just talk about them
but, you know, be able to point in the sky to where one of them is. And
then, you'd like to study it and find out whether this thing you think
is a black hole actually behaves as general relativity would predict
for such an object. And, in particular, there's this very strong
prediction from relativity that such a thing would not have a surface.
That it would have an event horizon down which things would
disappear--not a surface of any kind. And so, what I want to talk about
today is both of these steps.</p>

<p>And, the story starts in the late 1960s, in the middle of the 1960s,
when the first x-ray-- astronomical observations of x-rays were made.
So, it starts with x-ray astronomy. One of the features of astronomy
for the past half-century, or so, is that, you know, by the 1950s,
there had been a lot of astronomy, but it had all been done in optical
light, with optical telescopes. And the story of astronomy for the past
fifty years has basically been one after another of different kinds of
electromagnetic radiation, not optic--other than optical light, have
gradually been opened up.</p>

<p>The first of these was radio astronomy. And so, all of a sudden,
people point radio telescopes at the sky, and they find out all sorts
of things--one of which, for example, was pulsars, which we talked
about the last time.</p>

<p>The next part of the electromagnetic spectrum that was opened was
x-rays. Now, there's a problem with doing x-ray observations, which is
that x-rays don't make it through the atmosphere. The atmosphere is
completely opaque to x-rays. This is a good thing. The Sun emits
x-rays, and you would not want to be in a place in which you didn't
have an atmosphere to absorb the x-rays on the way to yourself. You'd
get skin cancer immediately. And so, the fact that the atmosphere
absorbs x-rays is good for everybody, except for the x-ray astronomers,
because it makes it difficult to do these kinds of observations. So,
this only got started at the point where you could put satellites into
orbit outside the atmosphere, and equip them with x-ray detectors,
basically Geiger Counters.</p>

<p>There's a lot of talk these days about going back to the Moon. And
one of the very few scientific advantages of a moon colony is that you
could do ground-based x-ray astronomy. And so, you know, you picture a
hobbyist in his backyard, you know, with a kind of Geiger Counter in a
coffee can, or something, going outside and observing x-rays from the
sky. And I think that would be a great thing--but I digress.</p>

<p>Let's see, x-ray astronomy, yes, in the 1960s. So, they send up
Geiger Counters on satellites, and increasingly sophisticated x-ray
telescopes over the years. And they discovered something that they
didn't expect. Namely--so, this is now in the 1960s also, around the
same time the pulsars were discovered. They also discover very strong
sources of x-rays; x-ray sources. And there's a lot of energy coming
out of these things, thousands of times, even hundreds of thousands of
times, the radiation that the Sun emits. Radiation--and from these
x-ray sources, essentially all of it in x-rays. There's small amounts
of optical, radio, other kinds of radiation, but basically these are
x-ray emitting stars. They're stars that emit huge amounts of x-ray
luminosity, and not a whole lot else. And they're very, very, very
powerful.</p>

<p>And so, people wondered what these were. These were unexpected.
Nobody had predicted that this would be there. And as they started to
think about what these things might be, they realized, well, what is
x-ray? An x-ray is a very energetic photon, very short wavelength
light; therefore, each one of the photons carries a big punch. So,
these are energetic photons. And the more energetic the radiation that
is emitted, in sort of general terms, the hotter the material that
emits it has to be, just in order to crank up the energy, you need.</p>

<p>That's why ordinary objects at room temperature glow in the
infrared. If you heat them up, they start at thousands of degrees.
Things start to glow in the red. You heat them up still further, you
get white light, blue light. If you crank things up to hundreds of
thousands of degrees, you start to get ultraviolet radiation. And it
turns out, in order to get x-rays, you need to have things that have
been heated up to millions of degrees.</p>

<p>So, energetic photons would come from--require high temperature, by
which I mean, you know, a million degrees, or so. By contrast, the Sun
and other similar stars, has a surface temperature of about 6,000
degrees. That's hot enough to glow in the optical, but not hot enough
to generate large numbers of x-rays. And you can also go further and
say, you can figure out how much radiation ought to come from a given
volume of million-degree, whatever it is.</p>

<p>And you discover--so, combining the temperature and the luminosity,
there's a little formula which I won't write down, which tells you how
big the thing has to be in order to emit that much radiation. If the
Sun were five times bigger, it would emit 5<sup>2</sup> more radiation.
And it turns out that if you combine this stuff, the emitting region is
small--much smaller than an ordinary star.</p>

<p>There's another argument, a completely different argument, that
whatever is emitting these x-rays has to be small, which is the
following: the brightness of these things varies. So, also, here's a
second argument. Brightness varies, and it varies quickly, hundreds of
times a second. Hundreds--so, on time scales of 1/100th of a second,
the brightness of these things can vary by a factor of 2, or more.</p>

<p>Now, that immediately tells you that the size of the region that is
emitting the radiation has to be smaller than 1/100th of a light
second. Because, imagine--here's a thing that's emitting radiation. And
so, it's got, you know, photons coming off in all directions. And
you're kind of over here watching the thing. If it suddenly changes
brightness, you'll see the brightness change from the front part of the
object before you see the brightness change from this part of the
object, because this part of the object has less of a distance to
travel to get to you. And so, the amount of time it takes light to get
from one side of this object to the other is a kind of minimum amount
of time that you would expect to be able to see a change in the
brightness.</p>

<p>Now, you can ask, what if just this little piece gets brighter?
Well, then, that little piece had better be emitting essentially all of
the radiation you see when it--all of the increased brightness of the
radiation that you see. And so, then, you just apply this same argument
to that little piece. And so, the size of this has to be less than 0.01
of a light second.</p>

<p>Now, light is 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters per second. So, the size of
these things has to be less than 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> meters. That's less
than what? 3,000 kilometers. This is something that's--so, all this
radiation, thousands of times the radiation that you see from the Sun,
all of it in x-rays has to be coming from something that's
substantially smaller than the Earth. And, in fact, some of these
things vary on time scales even smaller than that. So, lots of energy,
very small object. This points you, again, towards neutron stars,
because they can pack a considerable punch in a relatively small
volume. And as these objects were studied more and more, a picture came
up of what they actually were. And these are things that are called
x-ray binary stars. "Binary," meaning a double star--two stars in orbit
around one another. And the idea, here, is that one of these stars is a
kind of ordinary star like the Sun, got a slightly weird shape, which
I'll explain in a minute.</p>

<p>So, this is some kind of relatively ordinary star. And the other
star in the system that it's orbiting around is, well, the generic term
is, "compact object," an example of which would be a neutron star, or
potentially a black hole. And the deal is that these guys are orbiting
so close to each other that if you look at the gravitational force on
an atom of gas at this point of the star--</p>

<p>Oh, I should say, the reason that the star is this weird shape is
because of huge--this is basically a tide. This pulls one part of the
star towards it and that distorts the ordinarily spherical shape. And
so, you get this kind of teardrop thing. And if you analyze the
gravitational forces on an atom of gas, here, it's pulled in two
directions. It's pulled downward by--it's pulled towards the ordinary
star by the gravity of the ordinary star. But it's also pulled in the
other direction by the gravitational force of this other thing,
whatever it is. And at this, sort of, teardrop place, here, this peak
here, the gravity toward the compact object is greater. And that means
that the surface of this particular point on the surface of the
ordinary star, in fact, that material is pulled off the star and pulled
onto the compact object. It kind of--what happens is, it kind of goes
into orbit and it ends up orbiting around the compact object.</p>

<p>So, you have a gas stream, and all this stuff ends up in a big disk
of material, here, called an accretion disk. And so, basically, the gas
goes into orbit around the compact object. Now, you know something
about orbits. These are perfectly ordinary--each atom has its own
little orbit. The orbits are perfectly ordinary orbits, which can be
described by the usual set of equations. And one thing you know about
that is that the inner orbits go faster than the outer orbits. And so,
if you imagine two pieces of gas, sort of, right next to each other,
one inside the other, the inside one has to go faster. And so, they rub
against each other, the different parts of the gas.</p>

<p>So, this gas generates friction, and friction does two things.
First, it heats the stuff up. And where does the energy for that heat
come from? It extracts energy from the orbit, and that, in turn, leads
to the gas spiraling in. So, the gas in this disk gradually spirals in.
As it does, it creates a lot heat, generates a lot of radiation. And
what was demonstrated in the early 1970s is that the inner parts of
such an accretion disk can be heated up to millions of degrees, which
is exactly what you want to be able to explain the x-rays. So, inner
accretion disk goes up to millions of degrees, and that's where all
these x-rays are coming from. Okay. So, that's what these x-ray sources
are supposed, in principle, to be. And there's, by now, a lot of
evidence that this general picture is basically true. Questions?
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> When I was asking you before if we--you directly
observed a supermassive black hole that was what I was referring to,
would they in turn be the--these like [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> The accretion disks?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yes, absolutely. These are also
observed around supermassive black holes. That's where the light from
quasars comes from--from accretion disks around the supermassive black
holes. They have it, too. Again, the question of where that gas comes
from is a little less clear than it is in the case of the x-ray
binaries. But yes, this is why.</p>

<p>So, there's two ways you know that the supermassive black holes
exist. One is from the orbits of stuff around them, and the other is
from the emission from the accretion disk. But there isn't always gas.
The one in the center of our galaxy, there is no accretion disk, and
so, we don't see it at all. And so, in some cases they're accreting
gas, in other cases not. Presumably, that's also true of black holes in
binary star systems – that there are some of them that aren't close
enough to their companion to pull mass off, and we don't see them as
bright x-ray sources.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Does that necessarily mean that the objects nearby
aren't stable--I mean, are not getting pulled apart by them?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Sorry?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Does that mean that the--does that necessarily mean
the nearby objects are not getting pulled apart by these black
holes?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> The nearby objects are not getting
pulled apart. Well, the companion star is gradually being stripped of
all its gas by the black hole, in this case. But if it were a little
further away it would be a perfectly stable orbit. Other questions,
yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Why should the inside have a higher velocity than
the outside?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh. This is smaller. That's bigger.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Yeah, if your compact object is a neutron star, then
could it also be a pulsar?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> In principle, it could. In
practice, it turns out that all that gas swirling around does bad
things to the magnetic field and to the radio emission. So, in
practice, they tend not to be pulsars, but in principle, they could
be.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Also, is pulsar, by definition, like, one that's
oriented in such a way that we can see the pulsations or is it
[Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Well, I mean, it depends on exactly
how you define it. But a pulsar is something that emits radio from an
off-axis magnetic field. Presumably, if it doesn't happen to cross us,
we wouldn't know it's a pulsar, but somebody else in the galaxy
might.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Other questions at this point? All
right, so, having found a bunch of these x-ray binaries, the question
is, "Can you tell whether they're black holes or not?"</p>

<p>And now, let me remind you that the mass of a neutron star has to be
less than the three times the mass of the Sun. So, the plan is, you
observe the orbit of the companion, and determine the mass of the
compact object. And there's a derivation you can do, which I won't show
you, but again, you can look up on the black hole website, which
shows--remember what we're doing, here.</p>

<p>Let's observe the radial velocity of the companion versus time--goes
up, goes down. And you determine two things from this: the orbital
period and the amplitude of this sine curve, which I'm going to call
<i>K</i>. And it turns out, you can prove the following relationship.
This is actually easy to prove but it takes three pages to do it, so, I
won't go through the exercise. <i>PK</i><sup>3</sup> / 2π<i>G</i> is
equal to the mass of the compact object--the mass of the thing you
don't see, times sin<sup>3</sup><i>i</i>. I'll explain that in a
second--times 1 plus the mass of the object that--the ordinary star,
divided by the mass of the compact object, and this is squared.</p>

<p>So now, why would you do this? So, this is a little calculation. You
start with Kepler's laws. You do three pages of algebra. You come out
with this. It's written down on the classes server. Why would you
do--why would you express it in this particular form? Here's the deal.
This is called the mass function, so-called, and can be observed from
the velocity curve only.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yes, the whole term--this only.
That's called the mass function. And the term on the right, here, is
very interesting, because it's the mass of the object you don't see.
Mass of the compact object, times something that is less than 1, sine
of any angle.</p>

<p>Oh, I should say, the <i>i</i> here, this is the inclination of the
object to the line of sight, if it's coming exactly towards you and
away from, <i>i</i> is 90&nbsp;degrees. If it's going around this way,
it's zero. That has to be in there because you're observing radial
velocity.</p>

<p>But it doesn't matter what this is. Sine of anything is 1 or less.
Sine cubed of anything is 1 or less. So, this term up here has to be
less than 1. This term on the bottom has to be greater than 1. It's
1&nbsp;plus something squared. So, on the bottom, you have a term
that's greater than 1. That means that this quantity, which you can
easily observe, is less than the mass of the compact object. So, if the
mass function--you measure the mass function, and it comes out to be
greater than three solar masses, then the compact object is also
greater than three solar masses. And if that's true, it has to be a
black hole, because it has to be smaller, so small that it could
otherwise only reasonably be a neutron star. And yet it's bigger than
the mass of the neutron star itself.</p>

<p>There's a moderate technical problem with making this observation.
And the problem is, this is hard to observe, because the accretion disk
is too bright. So, the accretion disk outshines the star. Fortunately,
nature solves that problem for us, because many of these objects have
intermittent accretion. So the accretion happens. You see all these
x-rays. Then the accretion turns off for various reasons. And then,
when the accretion's off, all you see is the companion star, and so you
can--when the accretion is off, you can make this measurement.</p>

<p>So, here's how you go about finding a black hole. First, suddenly,
there's a new source of x-rays. The x-rays turn on in one of these
transient systems. Then, you wait. Then the x-rays turn off. This
happens after a few months, typically. Once the x-rays turn off, that
means the accretion disk isn't there anymore, and you measure the mass
function. And then, if that's greater than three solar masses, you win;
namely, you've discovered a black hole. And this is a sequence of
events that I'm rather fond of. This is what got me tenure. And so, I
thought I'd show you an example of how this works out in real life.
Let's see, okay. Here is--oh, let me turn the lights down just
slightly.</p>

<p>Right, so this is just a, sort of, artist's conception of an x-ray
binary. Here's the companion star. Here's the accretion disk. Down in
the middle, there is a compact object so small you can't see it. This
red stuff is supposed to be radio emission coming out of the poles. And
you can see the little gas stream going from one to another. This is
what it looks like when it's x-ray active. When the x-rays turn off,
what happens is, the stuff just piles up in the outer part of the
accretion disk. There's not enough friction to drive it down in there,
no x-rays, and basically, all you can see is the companion star.</p>

<p>So, let me now take you back fifteen years in time. This is
something that crossed my desk shortly after I came to Yale as an
assistant professor in the early 1990s. This is an astronomical
telegram. That's an old fashioned word. Now, of course, we do it all by
email. And these are a system for distributing the results of
fast-breaking news in the heavens. You know, if you see a supernova or
some exciting--or comet, or something exciting going off in the sky,
you can't wait to publish it for a year and a half, because, by then,
it will be gone, and no one else will study it. So, we have this system
for distributing news of fast-breaking events, so that other people can
study them.</p>

<p>In this particular case, there's a whole bunch of astro jargon down
in here. The title's the only thing you have to pay attention to.
"X-ray transient in the constellation of Musca." New x-ray source
suddenly appeared in Musca. These guys found it.</p>

<p>You've probably never heard of the constellation of Musca--Musca the
Fly. Yeah. There's two reasons you haven't heard of it. One is it's in
the southern hemisphere. You can't see it from here. But the other
reason is it's a pretty pathetic excuse for a constellation. It's one,
lousy, fourth magnitude star. That's why they call it the Fly, right?
But they had to call that part of the sky something, and it's now my
favorite constellation because it has this object in it.</p>

<p>Anyway, a bright x-ray source suddenly turned up in Musca. A month
or so later, the x-ray source was still bright. I found myself in this
lovely spot. This is an observatory in Chile where you can see the
southern hemisphere, among other things. And the two telescopes
pictured here--this was, at the time, the largest, most powerful
telescope in the southern hemisphere. This is the door, just to give
you a sense of scale.</p>

<p>And this thing here, in the foreground, which looms large in this
picture, but is actually much smaller than that, I have to tell you, is
one of the more far-flung outposts of the Yale Empire. This is Yale's
one-meter telescope. It was built in Bethany, Connecticut, and then in
the early 1970s, somebody said, well, Connecticut's a really stupid
place to have a research telescope, it snows all the time. And so they,
kind of, picked it up and took it down to Chile. And so, it's, by now,
only our second best research telescope, and I'm very fond of it.</p>

<p>And so, I found myself observing at this telescope a few months
after the discovery of this x-ray source in Musca. So, I junked the
program I thought I was going to do and looked at that thing, instead.
And what I found was that every 10.5 hours it got a little brighter,
and then a little fainter, and a then a little brighter. And this was
the--the accretion disk was still there, so presumably, this was some
effect, for example, of the companion star crossing in front of the
accretion disk, or something like that.</p>

<p>And so, I fired off my own telegram. There's two things you need to
know from this one. That's me. And the other one is that I claimed that
there was a 10.5-hour modulation in the brightness of the source, which
might be the orbital period. That's an interesting thing to know,
because if you know the orbital period, if you know <i>P</i> in the
mass function, and you think that this might turn out to be a black
hole, you can figure out how big <i>K</i> has to be in order for this
to be a black hole. And the answer is that if you were to measure the
radial velocity of this thing, the difference between the maximum and
the minimum radial velocity would be--if that were 800&nbsp;kilometers
a second or greater, then the compact object in this system would have
to be a black hole.</p>

<p>Problem was, I couldn't make that measurement, because, first of
all, the Yale telescope wasn't powerful enough to do it. Second of all,
the accretion disk was still too bright to allow observations of the
companion. So, I teamed up with a couple people who had done this once
already, before: Ron Remillard from MIT, Jeff&nbsp;McClintock from The
Smithsonian. And we applied to get time on the big telescope.</p>

<p>The big telescope, which I showed you, is from The National
Observatory, and you have to write a proposal to get time on it. Many
people want to get time on it. It's quite competitive. But we wrote a
good proposal. And so, the following year, after the x-rays had turned
off, they gave us three nights of telescope time on the big telescope
in order to make this radial velocity curve.</p>

<p>So, just to orient you, here's Chile. Here's the capital, Santiago.
Cerro Tololo's up in the Andes, here. So, you take this enormous plane
ride and then drive up to--drive up into here. And then, what happened
was--let's see. The first night it rained. This is kind of an
occupational hazard. The reason there are all these telescopes in Chile
is because it's mountains in the desert, which is an excellent place to
put telescopes. As it turns out, even in the desert, sometimes it's
cloudy, sometimes it rains. That was the first night, so that was
out.</p>

<p>The second night--oh, that was interesting, there was a hailstorm. I
don't know if you've ever been in a six-story high, hollow steel
building in the hail. It's a very interesting experience, but it's not
productive, scientifically. And so, you know, they give you these
little rooms to sleep in, which are light-tight and sound-tight,
because you have to sleep in the daytime. And so, there's this very
dramatic moment. You wake up at 4:00 in the afternoon and you raise the
shades to see if there are clouds. So, fortunately, the third of our
three nights, it was all clear. The storm had passed and we were able,
then--and so, now, we're sitting somewhere in this building, and we
were able to make our observations. So, let me show you what we
did.</p>

<p>Here is a plot of hours, time and hours, on the night of the 3rd of
April, 1992, versus radial velocity. So, this is going to be a radial
velocity plot. First thing we observed was this point, right after
sunset. And you notice that the object is coming toward us at 250
kilometers a second. That's already very good news. Because 250
kilometers a second is actually a little greater than the escape
velocity of the galaxy. And so, the only reason something would have
that kind of speed is if it was in orbit around some other nearby
object--or objects in the galaxy aren't usually that bright.</p>

<p>So, we made a couple more observations. And after the third
observation, it was clear that the basic parameters of this system
were, more or less, correct. It had started off coming at us at 250
kilometers a second. A couple hours later, it was going away from us at
200 kilometers a second. So, in a mere two hours, it had turned itself
around from coming at us at a high rate of speed, to going away from
us. So, that's good. It's in an orbit. It's in an orbit with a very
short period. And so, that was very encouraging.</p>

<p>And then, we collected more data. And by about midnight, we were
feeling pretty pleased with ourselves, because you can see what's
happening. It's now coming--going away from us at 400 kilometers a
second, but clearly it's about to turn around and go this way. If you
extrapolate 5 1/4 hours before this turnaround, you'd get a point down
here. That meant it would have been going from minus 400 to positive
400. That's 800 kilometers a second. If you believe that, then this
probably is a black hole.</p>

<p>So, we're feeling pretty pleased with ourselves. We opened a little
bottle of the local firewater--awful stuff called Pisco. You're not
supposed to do that, right? You're not supposed to operate heavy
machinery. And nature was not kind. We were punished for this. There
was a small earthquake. Chile's in an earthquake zone, and so, this
does bad things for precision-aligned optics. So, the next point was a
little skewed for reasons that we never explained in our paper. And
then, there was a gap where, for a little while, we didn't take any
data, while we were straightening ourselves out again.</p>

<p>And then, here's the next point. And so, now, that's encouraging
again. And then, more data was collected toward the end of the night.
And so, as dawn was beginning to come up, we were kind of back where we
started. The thing was coming towards us at 250&nbsp;kilometers a
second. And we really needed one more point down here, in order to nail
the whole thing down.</p>

<p>The problem was that the object, of course, is now setting in the
West. You know, the Earth turns, so objects rise in the East and they
set in the West. And if you can picture a telescope following an object
down into the West, it's sort of pointing like this. The principle
optical element in this telescope is a huge mirror, a four-meter wide
mirror. So, thirteen feet across. And it's not bolted down,
particularly, because if you put bolts in the mirror, changes in
temperature will change the size of the bolts, and it'll throw the
optics out of alignment. So, it's just, kind of, sitting there, and
it's tipping this way. And eventually it's going to, you know, fall
out, fall on the floor.</p>

<p>It is way more than seven years' bad luck for an astronomer to break
the primary mirror of the largest telescope in the southern hemisphere.
And so, they don't let the astronomers actually move the telescope
themselves. That would be far too dangerous. They have trained experts
to do this. And the trained expert was saying to us at this point, you
know, "You've got to stop observing this object. We're beyond the
safety limits," and so forth.</p>

<p>And we said, as scientists do, "No, no, in the interest of science,
we must have one more point." This argument went on for a while, and
they were about to, kind of, pull the plug on us. And then, we said,
"Okay, fine," you know, "we understand. Safety of the telescope is
paramount." But during the argument, we'd accumulated one more point.
And so, this is kind of the clinching case, down here, as it's coming
towards us at 400&nbsp;kilometers a second. So, we're very pleased with
ourselves.</p>

<p>Over breakfast, we did the exercise of finding the best-fit sine
curve. Here it is. And if you work out what the mass function is--the
orbital period is 10.5 hours--the mass function is 3.1 times the mass
of the Sun. So, very good, very good news. You'll notice this plus or
minus 0.05. The data's not all that great. We've subsequently gotten a
lot more data on this thing. It does turn out to be about 3.1. But it's
also true that--remember that that formula had this sin <i>i</i> in it.
And we were able, by other means, to determine what the inclination is.
And it's now clear that this object has a--that this binary system has
a compact object of a mass of about seven solar masses in it. Very,
very nice thing.</p>

<p>We published this paper. Other people have published other papers.
By now--oh, here's our telegram from the next morning. Again,
gobbledygook, except for the fact that the value of the mass function
is 3.1, "providing dynamical evidence that the primary is a black
hole."</p>

<p>So, we wanted to publish a paper, you know, entitled, "Black Hole
Found in the Constellation of Musca." People were a little cautious
about that. They said, you know, you haven't yet proved that Einstein's
relativity is correct. If Einstein's wrong, this doesn't necessarily
have to be a black hole. We said, come on. You get to assume that
Einstein's right. They said, well, maybe not. So, we get to call these
things, "dynamically confirmed black hole candidates." That's the
official word.</p>

<p>And here is the current collection of these things, scaled to the
Sun and Mercury. The one we were looking at, it's a very close one.
It's a 10.5-hour orbit. This thing, much bigger, thirty-hour
[correction: thirty-day] orbit, much bigger companion star. But all of
the black holes in here are sort of between five and fifteen times the
mass of the Sun.</p>

<p>And so, now, fifteen years later, there's a whole collection of
these things. There's also a collection of things that turned out to be
neutron stars. So now, you can do an experiment. And you can do
experiment in general relativity. Here's the derivation. I'll skip that
for you. And you can ask yourself whether event horizons actually
exist.</p>

<p>So, here's the experiment. You have a dozen or so things that are
neutron stars. You have another dozen or so things that are black
holes. You pour gas onto both of them. And indeed--you know, that's
what the companion stars are doing. That's why they have all these
x-rays.</p>

<p>What happens if gas falls on a neutron star? It picks up a lot of
speed and starts going at the speed of light and it hits right into the
surface. And so, when it hits the surface, all its kinetic energy, all
its thermal energy, has to stop. The kinetic energy stops, and all that
energy goes into the surface of the neutron star, somehow--what's
called a boundary layer--and has to, in some way, get re-radiated. It
basically heats up the surface of the neutron star. You get x-rays from
this surface layer.</p>

<p>Gas falling onto a black hole doesn't do it. It falls right through
the event horizon. And the kinetic energy and the thermal energy in
that gas just contributes to the mass of the black hole, and it doesn't
get re-radiated. So your prediction is, for the same amount of mass
falling onto a neutron star as onto a black hole, you would predict
that the neutron star would be brighter, because all of this extra
energy brought in by the accreting material would be radiated--whereas,
in the case of the black hole, it would not be. It would just be
captured by the black hole itself.</p>

<p>So, with the most sophisticated recent x-ray telescope, people have
tried to measure black holes and neutron stars in a situation where
they emit comparable amounts--where the mass accretion rate, the amount
of mass that's being accreted, is comparable. So, the black things here
are the black holes. The open circles are the neutron stars. This is a
measure of brightness and it's logarithmic. So, this is
10<sup>-8</sup>, 10<sup>-6</sup> and some silly set of units.</p>

<p>And so, this, between here and here, that's a factor of 100. This is
the orbital period. The reason they plot the orbital period is, there's
good reason to think that the amount of mass accretion is proportional
to the orbital period. So, you expect long orbits to have more mass
accretion than shorter ones.</p>

<p>But the point of this graph is clear. There's a gap you can drive a
truck through of about a factor of 100 in the brightness between the
neutron stars, the things that we think are neutron stars, and the
things we think of as black holes. And so, the interpretation of this
has been that the black holes don't have a surface. Because if they had
a surface, then all of this extra energy would have to radiate, as it
does in the case of the neutron stars.</p>

<p>So, this is a first step towards a test of strong-field general
relativity. It's only a first step, because you really have to
understand how much mass is falling, and what the geometry of the mass
flow is, and a whole bunch of very complicated gas dynamics. This is
sometimes called "gastrophysics." And so, that's what we're working on
doing now, to try and understand exactly what's going on with these
things. And if one understood that, then you might take such a plot to
represent a proof that event horizons exist. And so, that kind of
brings you up to 2007, in the study of strong-field relativity and
black holes. And that's the end of this section of the course. That's
the end of this section of the semester. Have a good break and we'll
torment you with a test afterwards.</p>
