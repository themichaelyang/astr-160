<p><strong>Professor Charles Bailyn:</strong> We were talking last time
about the objects in the Solar System. And we'd gone through kind of
two of the three stages of the scientific method as it's applied to
observational science rather than experimental science. And the first
thing was just making observations, finding a bunch of things. And so I
gave you a little slide show depicting some of the objects in our Solar
System. And after observations the next thing to do is classification,
and we did some of that too, and I divided all these objects that had
been discovered into six categories. And then, once you've done that,
once you have some categories that kind of make sense, then the next
thing is to interpret these results and to try and explain where these
categories come from, how they arise, and actually figure something
out. And I've described that as interpretation, and I want to offer you
a little bit of interpretation about what we've found about the Solar
System.</p>

<p>Now, I only want to explain some of the classifications. This is
actually a common thing to do. When you find a whole bunch of different
things and you've got twelve classes and three sub-classes and two
exceptions, you kind of want to explain the big features first and then
worry about the little things later. This is commonly done.</p>

<p>So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about only the inner
terrestrial planets. You'll recall that these are small, rocky things
in relatively short orbit, and contrast them with the outer planets,
the Jovian, the Jupiter-like planets, which are large and have not only
rocks, but also lots of ice and gas. And these things are in wider
orbit, but the orbits of both of these are, basically, more or less
circular. Not precisely circular, they're actually elliptical, but
quite close, and they're all in the same plane. That is to say, they're
all going around the same way. There's nothing that's going this way
instead of this way. So, they're circular and co-planar. And let's try
for an explanation of those particular features.</p>

<p>Okay, so this would be something like a Theory of Planetary
Formation: how the planets formed, why they get that way. This word,
"theory," is a serious problem. This is one of the foremost examples of
a word that means something different when scientists use it than when
normal people use it. In scientific parlance, a theory is something
which has a lot of support, which explains a lot of observed or
experimental fact. In everyday life, of course, a theory means a wild
guess. So, there's a pretty stark difference between those two
definitions. This gets our friends the evolutionary biologists, in all
kinds of trouble because they keep talking about the theory of
evolution. And a certain segment of society interprets that as the wild
guess of evolution and this creates various kinds of difficulties. The
problem is, there isn't another word that one can readily use for what
the science definition of this--you could use "paradigm," you could use
"scenario." These are kind of ugly sorts of words, so I think we're
stuck with "theory." But I mean this in the sense of something that
explains a lot of facts, rather than in the sense of wild guess.</p>

<p>Okay, so here we go: Theory of Planetary Formation. So, the idea is
that the planets form from a disk of material around the Sun. So, the
Sun and the planets are created out of a collapsing cloud. The cloud
collapses, some parts of the cloud are rotating, that prevents them
from collapsing. And so, you have a situation, after a while, where you
have a sort of star-like thing in the middle, and then a kind of disk
of stuff around it. So, this is a side view, and in the top view, all
these things are in orbit here. And this disk consists of basically the
same material as the Sun, which is to say, lots of gas, by which, I
mean hydrogen and helium in particular. Some ice, of course, when it's
in a star it's all melted. But these are elements like carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen, that go into making ices, and a little bit of heavier
elements that could, if you put them all together, form dust and rocks,
and things like that. A little heavier element: things like silicon and
iron. So, that's what the Sun consists of, and so does this disk
orbiting around it.</p>

<p>Then what happens? In the disk, things gradually stick together. So
rather than having individual atoms or molecules, the molecules and
atoms sort of run into each other, form dust grains, the dust grains
run--or ice crystals or whatever, those run into each other, form
bigger things. And you gradually make bigger things as the little
things collide with each other and stick. So in the disk, things
gradually stick together and become tiny little objects, which are
sometimes given the name "planetesimals." And then the "planetesimals"
bump into each other and stick. These stick together until you've got a
situation where in each region, each orbit, each distance from the Sun,
you've coalesced everything into one large object. And so you end up
with one big object in each region, by which I mean distance from the
Sun, distance from the star.</p>

<p>And this explains the orbits, because since these large objects have
been created by running a lot of small objects together, the
ellipticity of any of the elliptical part of the orbit of any of these
things tend to cancel out. Because one of these objects will be
elliptical in one direction; another will be elliptical in another
direction. If you put them all together they'll--that orbit will tend
to be circular. Similarly, some of the objects will be going up out of
the plane of the Solar System, some will be going down, but you'll run
them together and they'll all end up with kind of similar circular
co-planar orbits. So makes approximately--that's the approximate sign
[~]--circular, co-planar orbit. So, that's good because that's one of
the things we're trying to explain.</p>

<p>And there is an expected difference between how this works out in
the inner parts of the Solar System and how it works out in the outer
parts of the Solar System. In the Inner Solar System the ice and gas in
the "planetesimals" evaporates and does not become part of the planet
that gets formed. And so the planets are only the rocky parts. They
actually hold onto a little bit of the ice and gas, but not very much.
Whereas, in the Outer Solar System, the ice is frozen, and so it
behaves just like rocks. And so planets have rocks and ice. This means
that they're substantially more massive. And if they're sufficiently
massive, then they have enough gravity to hold onto the gas also--onto
gas as well. It's also true that in the Outer Solar System there's more
volume, there's more stuff, and so there's more stuff to build the
planets out of in the first place.</p>

<p>And so, this nicely explains the difference between the Inner Solar
System and the Outer Solar System. You build these things up out of
little chunks. But in the Inner Solar System the temperature is high
enough that the chunks of ice evaporate, and so you can't build them up
out of that. And so you get much, much smaller things made almost
entirely out of rocks, in contrast to the Outer Solar System where you
have enough ice, you build much bigger planets, and in some cases you
hang on to a lot of the gas as well.</p>

<p>So, this is interesting because it makes a prediction about how
other Solar Systems ought to look. Namely, that this difference between
inner planets and outer planets ought to exist everywhere. That
planetary systems--there should be a general feature, because there's
nothing of what I've said so far that's unique to the Sun. So planetary
systems should have inner rocky planets and outer Jupiter-like planets,
sort of gas-plus-ice sorts of planets, much bigger. And the dividing
line between these two kinds of planets is determined by temperature.
Because there will be some temperature where those ice things melt and
therefore you don't expect it to be at the same distance away from a
star. You expect it to be at the place where the temperature is the
same. Therefore, if you have a very bright star, hot star, you'll have
inner planets out further from that star, inner-type terrestrial
planets will go out further. And if you have a very dim faint star,
which doesn't generate as much heat, the gas planets will--the dividing
line between the gas planets and the terrestrial planets will be much
closer in. So the dividing line is determined by temperature, hence, by
the luminosity--the amount of energy given off of the star.</p>

<p>So now, this tells us what we're supposed to do next. Namely, go out
and find a whole bunch of other Solar Systems and verify this
prediction. Namely, that if you've got a really bright, hot star, you
ought to have rocks out fairly far in the Solar System, whereas, if you
have a dim star, you'll have Jupiter-like things coming in much closer.
And so that's what I want to talk about now, is how people went about
doing this and what the results were. And I'll tell you the punch line
in advance, which is that this totally doesn't work. But it's an
obvious prediction from our theory of planet formation that came about
by an examination of what was going on in our own Solar System.</p>

<p>Okay. So, observing exoplanets. How do you find these things? And
you'll recall we started down this track in the last lecture. The key
point here is that stars move too. It's not just the planet going
around a star, it's the planet and the star both go around the center
of mass of the system and the stars move, too. You can't see the
planets independently. And there was a little equation--the velocity of
the star times the mass of the star is equal to the velocity of the
planet times the mass of the planet. This is basically an equation of
momentum. The distance of the star to the center of mass, times its
mass, is equal to the distance of the planet to the center of mass,
times the mass of the planet. This is kind of a definition of the
center of mass. And sometimes, you don't want to deal with the
individual velocities or distances, you want to deal with the total
velocity or distances. And so that's just defined where if you want to
talk about the total that's obviously just <i>D</i><sub>star</sub> plus
<i>D</i><sub>planet</sub>. Similarly, for the total velocity and the
total mass, and that's just defining terms. And then, in order to
relate these distances to things that have shown up in our equations
and Kepler's Third Law, it's true that the maximum value of the total
distance--that is to say, the distance between these things can vary,
because they can be in elliptical orbits. Sometimes they're closer than
others. And if you take the maximum distance between them--that's the
maximum of <i>D</i><sub>total</sub>--that's <i>a,</i> that's the
semi-major axis of the orbit.</p>

<p>And now, for nearly circular orbits, as the planets turn out to be,
then <i>D</i><sub>total</sub> is always the same, because if it's
circular the distance between them doesn't vary. So then,
<i>D</i><sub>total</sub> is more or less equal to the semi-major axis
because it's always the same, therefore it's always near its own
maximum.</p>

<p>And then, you can also say something interesting about the velocity.
The velocity--what's the definition of velocity? Velocity is miles per
hour, or something like that. So, it's distance per time. And let's
take a time period of one orbital period and ask the question, how far
does something go in one orbital period? Well, it goes all the way
around its orbit. And you may recall from high school geometry that if
you know the radius of a circle, you also know its circumference. The
circumference is the distance it would have to travel, that's 2π times
the radius. This is the basic fact from geometry and so that's 2π times
the distance, in this case, the semi-major axis. But this is only true
for nearly circular orbits and the reason is that in highly elliptical
orbits, the velocity changes by a substantial amount. It moves much
faster when it's closer. And so you can only really define what the
overall velocity of the thing is, if you've got a nearly circular
orbit. But in that case, as is true for planets, this 2π<i>a</i> over
<i>P</i> gives you a value for velocity.</p>

<p>Now, so we have another little equation here, <i>V</i> equals
2π<i>a</i> / <i>P</i>. This is an important one, so you'll want to
remember that. And I should say, which kind of <i>V</i>s and <i>a</i>s,
remember up here there is <i>V</i><sub>star</sub>,
<i>V</i><sub>planet</sub>, <i>V</i><sub>total</sub>, all these
different kinds of things. What do I actually mean by that? And it can
mean any of them, but it has to be consistent. So if you're dealing
with the velocity of the star then <i>a</i> is equal to
<i>D</i><sub>star</sub>. Remember these are all nearly circular orbits
so <i>D</i> isn't going to change. And if you've--if you're dealing
with <i>V</i> of the planet, then <i>a</i> is equal to <i>D</i> of the
planet, and that is approximately equal to <i>D</i><sub>total</sub>.
Because the mass of the planet is so low that almost all the motion in
the system comes from the planet. So, you can also deal with
<i>V</i><sub>total</sub> <i><sub>,</sub></i> which is equal to
<i>V</i><sub>planet</sub>. And so, all these things go together. But if
you're worried about the velocity of the star, you have to be careful,
because it's not <i>a</i> of the orbit as a whole, it's just a tiny
piece of the orbit that involves the motion of the star.</p>

<p>Okay? Let's do an example. How fast does the Earth move? <i>V</i> =
(2π<i>a</i>) / <i>P</i>. Well, we know <i>a</i> is equal to one
Astronomical Unit. <i>P</i> is equal to one year for the Earth's orbit,
and so the velocity of the Earth is 2π Astronomical Units per year.
Pretty straightforward but not very informative, because we don't have
a feeling for measuring velocities in Astronomical Units per year.
There's a joke in--a kind of physics joke that you convert all
velocities into furlongs per fortnight just to be annoying. But let's
not do that; let's convert it instead into meters per second, because
then we have the hope of understanding what's going on.
<i>V</i>&nbsp;is equal to 2π. One Astronomical Unit is 1.5 times 10 to
the 11 meters. And a year is 3 x 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;seconds.</p>

<p>π / 3 = 1.</p>

<p>2 x 1.5 = 3.</p>

<p>10<sup>11</sup> / 10<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<p>11 - 7 = 4. So, this is 10<sup>4</sup> meters per second, that's 30
kilometers per second. So, we move right along as we go around the
Sun.</p>

<p>If you did this for Jupiter, plugged in the various values for
Jupiter--I won't actually do that calculation, you can do it on your
own--you discover that Jupiter moves about half as fast as the Earth.
So, it goes around 15 kilometers per second, that's 1.5 x
10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;meters per second. So now, we can ask the question,
"How fast does the Sun move in response to the orbit of these planets?"
So how fast is the solar motion induced by Jupiter? Okay, and now we go
back to this momentum equation. Velocity of Jupiter times the mass of
Jupiter is equal to the velocity of the Sun times the mass of the Sun.
What we want to know is the velocity of the Sun. And so that is equal
to the velocity of Jupiter, which we just calculated, times the mass of
Jupiter, divided by the mass of the Sun. 1.5&nbsp;x 10<sup>4</sup>,
that's the velocity of Jupiter. Mass of Jupiter, as it happens--I think
I wrote this down last time, 2&nbsp;x 10<sup>27</sup> kilograms. Mass
of the Sun, 2&nbsp;x 10<sup>30</sup>. Twos cancel, obviously. We get
1.5&nbsp;x 10<sup>4</sup>. Times 10<sup>27</sup>, that's
10<sup>31</sup>. 10<sup>31</sup> / 10<sup>30</sup>=10<sup>1</sup>. Is
equal to 15 meters per second, not kilometers now, meters.</p>

<p>And so the Sun--Jupiter moves 15&nbsp;kilometers per second, the Sun
moves 15 meters per second. That makes perfect sense, because the Sun
is 1,000 times more massive than Jupiter, so it has to be going 1,000
times more slowly. So instead of moving at some number of kilometers
per second, it's moving at some number of meters per second. This, it
turns out, can be detected with modern equipment. "Detectable," let's
say, in distant stars. You can see things that move by 15 meters a
second. We'll come back to how that's done in a minute.</p>

<p>How about the Earth? Solar motion due to Earth. Now, you might think
is going to be bigger, because the velocity of Earth is bigger than the
velocity of Jupiter. But, of course, the mass is much, much smaller. So
we have <i>M</i><sub>earth</sub><i>V</i><sub>earth</sub> is equal to
<i>M</i><sub>sun</sub> <i>V</i><sub>sun</sub>, where
<i>V</i><sub>sun</sub> now means the motion induced by Earth. This
number is bigger than it was for Jupiter, but this number's a whole lot
smaller. And so the overall effect is that the <i>V</i><sub>sun</sub>
is going to be smaller,
<i>V</i><sub>earth</sub><i>M</i><sub>earth</sub> /
<i>M</i><sub>sun</sub>. That's 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>, that's the velocity.
Mass of the Earth, as it turns out, is 6&nbsp;x 10<sup>24</sup> meters
per second. The Sun, down here at 2 x 10<sup>30</sup>, same Sun. 6 / 2
= 3. 3&nbsp;times 3 is 10, so we get (10<sup>1</sup> x 10<sup>4</sup> x
10<sup>24</sup>) / 10<sup>30</sup>. One--five--29 over 30.&nbsp;That's
10<sup>-1</sup> = 1 / 10 of a meter per second, or 10&nbsp;centimeters
per second.</p>

<p>So that's much, much slower than the Sun moves in response to
Jupiter. Why? Because the Earth is so much less massive. So, 15 meters
a second for--as the result of Jupiter, only 10&nbsp;centimeters a
second, a tenth of a meter per second, as a result of Earth. And with
current technology, things that slow are not detectable, yet in
other--around--in other stars. So, we have a situation, and this is
what was happening about ten years ago, where instruments had been
developed that could, in principle, see the reflex motion of stars due
to planets like Jupiter, but weren't yet capable of seeing the motion
of stars due to planets like Earth. But, we expect that Solar Systems
ought to have planets like Jupiter, and so people went out to try and
look.</p>

<p>All right, how do you find--How do you observe these things? And
now, if you've taken high school physics, you will recall, perhaps,
something called the Doppler Shift. This is the key. And this is a way
of measuring velocity and it turns out oddly enough that velocities are
some of the most easy and straightforward things to measure in
astronomical objects because you can determine them by the Doppler
Shift. And so just to remind you or to inform you, if you haven't seen
this before, and there is some help sheets and things that you can look
at about this too. Light is characterized by its wavelength, which is
usually given the Greek letter Lambda [λ]. And light that is something
like 4&nbsp;x 10<sup>-7</sup> meters. A wavelength has units of length.
This looks blue to us. Light that is--let's color code this for your
convenience, 5 x 10<sup>-7</sup> meters looks green, 7 x
10<sup>-7</sup> meters kind of looks red. Longer wavelengths are what
we call "infrared." And shorter wavelengths that we can't see are
called "ultraviolet." And so, ultraviolet up here. And if you get
really, really long--if you have, like, meter wavelengths--that's radio
waves, out here. And if you have really short wavelengths, those are
x-rays and gamma rays. So, all of these kinds of radiation are
basically the same thing, called "electro-magnetic radiation"; again,
there's a help sheet. These are all electro-magnetic radiation, and
what kind of radiation it is depends on the wavelength.</p>

<p>And the key to the Doppler Shift is that the observed wavelength
changes, depending on the relative motion of the thing emitting the
light in the observer. Motion of source and observer. In particular, if
they're moving toward each other, then the wavelength gets shorter, and
if they're moving away from each other, the wavelength gets longer.</p>

<p>Do you feel an equation coming on? Because obviously this is going
to need to be quantified, right? How much shorter? How much longer? But
before we do that, let me just point out that this motion towards is
sometimes called a "blueshift" because it makes--it pushes the light
from the red end of the visual spectrum towards the blue and this kind
of thing here, the motion away from each other is called the
"redshift."</p>

<p>And let me show you why this is true before I write down the
equation. Let's see, it's just--let me get out of that and try this one
instead. It's just a property of how waves look, so look what happens.
If the thing is stationary there, in the middle, that's emitting the
waves, then the waves propagate equally in all directions, and both
observers see the same distance between successive waves. That is to
say, the same wavelength. And you can see that there. Then, when the
thing is moving in some direction, each successive wave is emitted a
little bit closer to one observer, and a little further away from the
other observer. And so, because the waves are emitted at different
places, the wave fronts here--I'll wait until this cycle goes through
again. The wave fronts for this observer are closer to each other and
the wavelengths looks shorter. So, when the thing is coming towards you
that's emitting the wave, it looks shorter to the observer it's going
towards. Whereas, for this guy, the waves--each successive wave is
emitted a little bit further away. And so the wave fronts are further
away from each other when they pass, and then the wavelength becomes
longer.</p>

<p>So, that's the kind of conceptual thing that's going on. And the key
thing is that the velocity that's relevant here is velocity toward and
away from you. If the thing is going sideways, it doesn't make any
difference. And so, it's not actually velocity that you observe by
looking at the Doppler Shift. It's radial velocity, which is the
technical term for--is the thing coming towards you or moving away from
you. And how fast is it coming towards you and how fast is it moving
away from you? Okay, let me turn this off here.</p>

<p>So here's the equation for that--let's see here. Lambda is the
wavelength--I'll explain all these terms in a minute. And this is
important. And the terms mean the following things: this is radial
velocity [<i>V</i><sub>r</sub>], and it's positive when it's going away
from you. It's negative when it's going towards you. And it's zero when
it's going sideways. And it's a velocity, it's in meters per second or
whatever the appropriate units of--furlongs per fortnight, or whatever
the appropriate units are. The only restriction on the units is, it has
to be in the same units as the thing in the denominator, here. That's
<i>C</i>, that's the speed of light. That's 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters
per second. Maybe we should have you work it out in furlongs per
fortnight. No, no, no, we won't do that. But as long as the velocity
here is expressed in the same terms as you express the speed of light,
then the units will work out. This λ with the little zero at the bottom
is the rest wavelength, so that's the wavelength you would observe from
whatever light source, electro-magnetic radiation source you have, if
nothing was moving. And Delta Lambda [∆λ], this is not ∆ times λ.
That's one symbol, confusingly enough. Delta always means change; you
may remember this from calculus if you've taken calculus. Delta always
means change, so this is a change in velocity--sorry, change in the
wavelength. And it is defined such that the observed wavelength is
equal to the rest wavelength, plus the change in the wavelength induced
by the radial velocity.</p>

<p>So now, look how this works. If this side of the equation is
negative--if it's coming towards you--then this quantity is negative.
That means this quantity is negative. That means this quantity is
negative. That means the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest
wavelength, which is exactly how it's supposed to be. When we come
towards you, it's blueshifted, the wavelengths get shorter. Similarly,
if this is going--if something's going away from you then
<i>V</i><sub>r</sub> is positive, this is positive, and you end up with
a longer wavelength. Okay?</p>

<p>All right, example: how fast do you have to go to turn a red light
green? This is potentially useful should you ever be pulled over for
running a red light. You can just say, "it looked green." How fast to
make a red light green? And let's call green light 5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>
meters. Red light is 7 x 10<sup>-7</sup> meters. So ∆λ had better be
equal to (7 - 5) x 10<sup>-7</sup>. That's 2
x10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;again in meters. And we want this to be negative,
because we want λ<sub>0</sub> to be the red. That's what it would be
like if nothing was moving and we want λ<sub>observed</sub> to be
green. And λ<sub>observed</sub> = λ<sub>0</sub> + ∆λ. And this had
better be, - 2 x 10<sup>-7</sup> meters. And so ∆λ / λ <sub>0</sub>,
that's (- 2 x 10<sup>-7</sup>) over (5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>).So that's -
2/5 is equal to the radial velocity over the speed of light. So, if
you're going at - 2/5 the speed of light, then the red light looks
green. Now, the minus just means you have to be moving toward that
light.</p>

<p>Now, two things about this, first of all, don't use this as an
excuse, because it'll cost you much more in the ticket for going over
the speed limit if you're going at 2/5 of the speed of light. Second of
all, be wary of this a little bit because there is, in fact, a change
to the equation that happens when you're going close to the speed of
light, and we'll talk about that when we get to relativity. And so this
is just an example of how this works out. But when you're dealing with
the motions of stars – 15 meters per second, 10&nbsp;centimeters a
second--you're nowhere near the speed of light, and so the equation
that I wrote down is actually fine.</p>

<p>So, what do you expect to see when you're looking at a star, which
has a planet in orbit around it? Looking at a star in some kind of
orbit--so here's the radial velocity as a function of time. And the key
thing about orbits is that the radial velocity changes, because first
the thing's coming towards you then later in its orbit it turns around
goes the other way. Then it comes back and it comes towards you, turns
around and goes the other way. So, the radial velocity will change from
positive to negative and back as the object first comes towards you,
then away from you. And so, it'll look like this if you make a whole
bunch of observations of this.</p>

<p>It turns out that for circular orbits, this is a sine wave. And if
you were to observe this, you could observe directly from such a plot,
if you made repeated observations of the radial velocity of a star, or
some other thing in orbit, you could observe two things. First of all,
you would immediately be able to tell what the orbital period is.
That's the amount of time--this is a time axis--it takes for the object
to come back to the same place in the orbit for a second time.</p>

<p>Second of all, you could tell something about what the velocity is.
The amplitude of this sine wave is something to do with the overall
velocity, because that's the maximum velocity it has coming towards
you. But you have to be a little careful here, because that's only true
if the object--if the orbit is edge-on. Let me explain what I mean by
that, we'll come back to this later. If the orbit's going this way,
then it never comes towards you or goes away from you--it's always
going sideways. If, on the other hand, the orbit's going this way, then
first it comes towards you, then it goes away from you. And if it's
somewhere in between, you only see part of the motion of the orbit in
terms of radial velocity. So, this amplitude is <i>V</i> if the orbit
is edge-on. If not, <i>V</i> is going to be more than that, because
you're only seeing part of the motion. That's a detail we'll come back
to later. So, this is what you expect to see if there's a planet going
around the star, and if you have enough sensitivity in your
measurements of the Doppler Shift to be able to actually see that
motion.</p>

<p>Okay, so here's what they saw. This is a star called 51 Pegasus, in
the Constellation of Pegasus. It is a "solar analog," so-called, by
which they mean, it's about as much like the Sun as they can--as you
can find if you go out and look at other stars. So it's very, very much
like the Sun. This is a radial velocity curve. I have taken the axis
off for a reason I'll point out later. This is radial velocity versus
time, and this is exactly what you expect to see. It goes up; it comes
down--very good news. This is exactly what you expect to see for a
planet.</p>

<p>There are two problems here, as it turns out. Problem number one is
the <i>X</i>-axis, because it turns out, the amount of time it takes
you to go one orbit around for this object is a little more than four
days. The shortest orbital period of a planet in our own Solar System
is that of Mercury, which is eighty-eight days, so this thing is way
closer to the star than anything in our solar system. <i>X</i>-axis
problem is that <i>P</i> is equal to around four days.</p>

<p>Problem number two is the <i>Y</i>-axis. And now let me put some
units on to this thing. I've done a very bad thing of showing you a
graph with no units, but it was just to prolong the suspense here.
<i>V<sub>R</sub></i>. Zero. So, that's going sideways. This is
50&nbsp;meters a second. This is negative 50 meters a second. And so
first it--here it's coming towards you, there it's going away from you.
And so, the amplitude of this thing, and therefore the velocity of the
star, is something like 50 meters a second. Now, it's less obvious why
that's a problem, but it is. And let me show you why. Let me do the
equation--do the equations a little bit.</p>

<p>Okay, so this is a solar analog. What is the semi-major axis of the
planets orbit? Axis of planet. We know <i>P</i> is equal to--let's see
4 / 365.24 is equal to 1 / 100 is equal to 10<sup>-2</sup> in years.
That's four days over a year. And <i>M</i> is equal to 1 solar mass
because it's a solar analog. So, <i>a</i><sup>3</sup> =
<i>P</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p><i>M</i> = (10<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><i>M</i> is equal--one. 10<sup>-4</sup>--</p>

<p>So <i>a</i> is equal to 10 to the--well let's--we got to do this
right. (100 x 10<sup>-6</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup>.</p>

<p>5<sup>3</sup> = 125. So the cube root of 100 is 5.</p>

<p>5&nbsp;x 10<sup>-2</sup> Astronomical Units. Or let's put it in real
units here. 5 x 10<sup>-2</sup>. An Astronomical Unit is 1.5 x
10<sup>11</sup> meters.</p>

<p>5 x 1.5 is like 7 x 10<sup>9</sup> meters. So that's how--that's the
semi-major axis--and if you compare it, if you go look at the lists of
planets in our own Solar System, what you'll discover is that's way
closer than any of the planets in our own Solar System--way closer to
the star than Mercury is.</p>

<p>I haven't used the <i>Y</i>-axis yet. Now I'm about to, because what
I'm going to do is, I'm going to take--I'm going to figure out the
velocity that this planet is moving at. That's 2 π <i>a / P</i>. You
wrote that down a little while ago; <i>a</i>, I just figured out. So, 2
times π times 7 times 10<sup>9</sup>. <i>P</i> is 1/100 of a year. So,
that's 10<sup>-2</sup>, times 3 x 10<sup>7</sup>, which is the number
of seconds in a year. π / 3 = 1.</p>

<p>2&nbsp;x 7 = 15.</p>

<p>10 <sup>9</sup> –</p>

<p>10<sup>-2</sup> x 10<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<p>10<sup>5</sup> --</p>

<p>So, this is 15 x 10<sup>4</sup>, or 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup>. So this is
thing is going--the planet now, this is <i>V</i><sub>total</sub>, which
is approximately equal to <i>V</i><sub>planet</sub>, is going at 150
kilometers a second. Much faster than the Earth is going around; well,
that makes perfect sense. It's in closer--got to move faster to stay in
its orbit. And so, this is 150 kilometers a second if you prefer those
units. Now, we know the velocity of the planet, we know the mass of the
star, we know the velocity of the star and so we can figure out the
mass of the planet.</p>

<p>Here's how it works. <i>M</i><sub>p</sub><i>V</i><sub>p</sub> =
<i>M</i><sub>star</sub><i>V</i><sub>star</sub>.</p>

<p><i>V</i><sub>planet</sub>, we've just figured out, is 1.5&nbsp;x
10<sup>5</sup>. Actually, let's leave it as 15&nbsp;x 10<sup>4</sup>,
that'll turn out to be easier for the arithmetic. The mass of the
stars, the same as the mass of the Sun, 2 x 10<sup>30</sup>. The
velocity of the star we just observed. We saw it moving back and forth,
it's 50 kilometers a second, 5 x 10<sup>1</sup>. Okay, so now--and this
is multiplied by the mass of the planet.</p>

<p>So, the mass of the planet is equal to 2&nbsp;x 10<sup>30</sup>,
times (5 x 10<sup>1</sup>) / (15 x 10<sup>4</sup>).</p>

<p>5 / 15 is a third, so this is a third times 10<sup>-3</sup>, times
the mass of the Sun. 10<sup>-3</sup> times the mass of the Sun, that's
the mass of Jupiter. So, this is equal to 1/3 of the mass of
Jupiter--which is, by the way, bigger than the mass of Saturn or any
other object in our own Solar System.</p>

<p>Okay, so that's catastrophic, right? That's a hopeless disaster,
because the first part of the lecture and the second part of the
lecture have entirely contradicted each other. Because in the first
part of the lecture I gave you a whole song and dance, and you all
wrote it down, and it sounded believable at the time. How inner planets
were going to be these small rocky things. And now the very first
planet we go out and find turns out to be a very close planet that's
quite massive. And this is impossible according to this nice little
theory of planetary formation that I promulgated to you earlier in the
lecture. And so, the very first planet that was observed turned out to
be a screw-up. Worse than that, there were soon dozens more like it
discovered.</p>

<p>These are given the name "Hot Jupiters," and you can see what the
problem is. If you figure out what the surface temperature of these
things ought to be, it's over 1,000 degrees. There's no way you could
have gas or ice on such a thing, it would totally melt. And there
aren't enough rocks in the whole rocky elements--silicon and iron, and
so forth--in the whole of the planetary system of our own Solar System
to add up to 1/3 of a Jupiter, even if you put them all together.</p>

<p>So how is this done? What is going on here? It seems clear that one
of the two things must be true. Either this thing isn't a planet and
there's some other explanation for this attractive bunch of data here,
or something has gone seriously wrong in our understanding of how
planets form. And stay tuned, we'll talk about that next time.</p>
