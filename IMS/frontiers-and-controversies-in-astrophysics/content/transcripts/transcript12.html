<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Okay, here's the plan for today. I
want to do one last foray into relativity theory. And this is going to
be a tricky one, so I hope you're all feeling mentally strong this
morning. If not, we--gosh, we should have ordered coffee for everyone.
And, in so doing, I want to introduce one key concept, and also answer
at least three of the questions that you guys have asked before in a
more--in more depth, and also relate the whole thing back to black
holes. And then, having done that, we'll have some more questions. And
then, having done that, I want to get back to astronomy; that is to
say, to things in the sky that actually manifest these relativistic
effects. So, that's where we're going today. And along the way, as I
said, we'll deal with some of the questions you've been asking in a
deeper kind of way. In particular--so, questions.</p>

<p>Watch out for the answers to these questions. Somebody asked,
"What's special about special relativity, and what's general about
general relativity?" How do they relate? So, we'll come back to that
one. Somebody also asked, "Why use the speed of light to convert time
into space and vice versa, to get them in the same coordinate system?"
So, why use <i>c</i> to convert time to space and vice versa? And then,
also, there was the question of, you know, "What is the mathematical
formulation of general relativity?" So, how to express general
relativity in some kind of equation. And we'll get to the key equation,
which is something called a metric, for general relativity, and then
we're going to stop. Because to go on from there is fairly heavy
calculus and we're just not going to do that. But I want to get at
least that far.</p>

<p>Okay, so let's go back to special relativity for a minute. So,
special relativity. Flat space-time, no gravity. And you'll recall what
happens. As you get close to the speed of light, all sorts of things
that you thought were kind of constant and properties of objects, like
mass and length and duration, and duration of time, and things like
that, all start to get weird and change. So, length, time, mass, all
these things, vary with the velocity of the person doing the
measuring.</p>

<p>And so, you could ask the question, is there anything that doesn't
vary? Is there anything that's an invariant? And the answer is, yes.
There are some things that don't vary. So, some things are invariant.
And Einstein actually said later in his career that it's actually the
invariants that are important, not the things that change. And so, he
should have called his theory invariant theory instead of relativity
theory. Think of what that would have done to pop philosophy. Instead
of saying, "everything is relative," all this stuff, you would have had
the exact same theory. You would have called it invariance theory. And
the pop philosophy interpretation of this would be, "some things never
change." And it would have been a whole different concept in three in
the morning dorm room conversations.</p>

<p>Okay, so some things are invariant, what things? Now, let me first
give you a little bit of a metaphor and then come back to how this
really works in space-time. Supposing you're just looking at an
<i>xy</i>-coordinate system and you have two points in a
two-dimensional space. So, here's a point and here's a point. Now, if
you arrange for some kind of coordinate system--here's a coordinate
system. This is <i>x</i>, this is <i>y</i>--and you ask how far apart
these points are. Well, you can do that--let's see. They're separated
in <i>x</i> by this amount here, which we'll call delta [Δ] <i>x.</i>
And they're separated in <i>y</i> by this amount here, and that's Δ
<i>y</i>. But of course, those quantities depend on the orientation of
your coordinate system. If I now take this coordinate system and I
shift it like this, now it's going to be totally different. Now I'm
going to have <i>x</i> look like this and I'm going to have <i>y</i>, Δ
<i>y</i> look like that. So Δ <i>y</i> has gotten a whole lot smaller.
Δ <i>x</i> has gotten a whole lot bigger. And all I did was twist the
coordinate system. Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible.]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> You still get the same distance,
thank you very much, that's exactly right. The distance is the
invariant. The <i>x</i>-coordinate and the <i>y</i>-coordinate, those
vary with the coordinate system, but the distance is the same. That's
exactly the point. And so, the quantity--let me summarize this.</p>

<p>For points on a 2-D space, Δ <i>x</i> varies. Δ <i>y</i> varies. But
there is a quantity that is invariant and that is--well, let's call it
(Δ <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>) + (Δ&nbsp;<i>y</i><sup>2</sup>), which is the
distance squared, (Δ <i>D</i><sup>2</sup>). And this is invariant. It
doesn't matter which way you twist things around, that will--that
quantity will remain the same.</p>

<p>So, now, imagine that you've got events in space-time. So an event
in space-time has three spatial coordinates and one time coordinate.
So, it's basically a point in a four-dimensional space. And as your
velocity changes, the distance and time also change. That's the
equivalent of rotating the coordinate system.</p>

<p>But there is something that doesn't change, and let me write that
down. This is usually given the Greek letter Tau [T] squared. And this
is equal to (Δ <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>) + (Δ&nbsp;<i>y</i><sup>2</sup>) +
(Δ <i>Z</i><sup>2</sup>) - <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>
(Δ<i>T</i>)<sup>2</sup>. And this is invariant. This is an invariant
interval, sometimes called proper distance. And as you change your
velocity--as the space, as the mass, as the time all change--this
quantity, describing the separation of two events--so, this describes
the separation of two events, that quantity changes--doesn't change.
That quantity is invariant.</p>

<p>Okay, so now, this answers one of the questions that was asked
before. Why does one use <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> or <i>c</i> to transform
the space coordinate into the time coordinate and back? It's because
you need the <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> out here in order to make this
invariant. If you're calculating the distance, if you use
<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> plus 1/2 <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> or some other
constant times <i>y</i><sup>2</sup>, you're not going to get something
that's invariant. And it's only when you use the <i>c,</i> here, that
you end up with something that's invariant.</p>

<p>And so, if you think about these as representing the four
coordinates of the system, it's clear this one coordinate is <i>x</i>,
one is <i>y</i>, one is <i>z,</i> just as you would expect. And then,
there's this other coordinate, which is <i>c</i> times <i>T</i>, but
it's negative so it has to be times the square root of -1. So, the four
coordinates in space-time can be thought of as <i>x, y, Z</i> and <i>i
cT</i>, if you want to think of it that way. And the time coordinate is
imaginary, because when you square it, you have to end up with a
negative number. Don't worry about the details of that. But the
presence of the <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> here is why you have to use
<i>c,</i> in particular, to get from time to space and back. And that's
necessary because this is the thing that doesn't vary with
velocity.</p>

<p>All right. So, this is actually kind of a weird expression. Because
unlike the distance between two points--and you'll notice, these three
terms put together, that's just the distance squared, ordinarily, but
that is not invariant anymore, because there's this other term here,
which can vary. Unlike the distance, this doesn't have to be positive.
You've got three different cases here. This interval can be zero for
different points. In ordinary distance it can only be zero if the two
points are the same, but this can be zero for different points, for
different events. It can be zero, it can be negative, and it can be
positive. So, what does that mean? What happens when it's zero?</p>

<p>So, if the interval is zero, that means that the distance between
the events in light-years, for example, is equal to the time separation
in years, because that's--because this term has to be exactly equal to
that term there, in order for them to subtract out and get zero. And
the <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> converts from light-years to years and back
again.</p>

<p>And so, what does that mean? That means if you emit a photon at one
event, that same photon can, if it's going in the right direction, be
present at the second event. So, if you ride along with light you'll
see both--you'll participate in both these events. So, you sit at event
one. You flash a light. You ride along with the expanding light waves
from that event and you get to something one light-year away, exactly a
year later. And so, if the second event is one light-year away in
distance and a year later in time, that same photon will be present at
the second event, as at the first event. So, things that have one of
these intervals of zero are separated by an appropriate amount so that
the same ray of light can participate in both of them. So, if the
interval--let's keep that up there for a minute.</p>

<p>If the interval is negative, what does that mean? The distance is
less than the light travel time. So, the photon is already past the
second event. So, if you were to emit a ray of light at event number
one, it would have passed the second event by the time it occurred. The
photon has already gone by. And similarly, if the interval is positive,
then the light photon hasn't reached event two--hasn't yet reached
event two. Now, this is important, because this means that you can't
communicate from event one to event two. So, if you're at event two,
you don't know what happened at event one. Because even if you'd sent
out a signal, a radio signal or whatever, it would not have reached you
by the time event two takes place. So you can't communicate from event
one to event two. And similarly, you can't travel from event one and
reach event two, because you'd have to go faster than the speed of
light to do it. These kinds of intervals, these negative intervals,
these are called time-like, because the time term is larger than the
distance turn. And these kinds of intervals are called space-like
intervals. And you can only travel or communicate over time-like
intervals. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What are these so-called events?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> So, they're events--you can think
of them as points in space-time. So, they have a particular position in
space and a particular point in time. So, they can be described by four
numbers, three spatial coordinates and a time coordinate. They can be
anything. You know, turning on a light, doing anything you want to do.
Receiving a photon, whatever it is. But they are points in a
four-dimensional space-time and therefore require four numbers to
describe them. And you can only get from one to another if they're
separated from a time-like, that is to say, a negative, interval.</p>

<p>Okay, so this expression, which I'll write down again, this is
called a metric. And the particular metric that I've written down here
is the metric for flat space. Because remember, this is special
relativity. There's no masses, no curvature of space, none of that
stuff, yet. This is the metric for flat space with no mass present.</p>

<p>And there are many other metrics possible. Any time you add mass or
do other things, you get different kinds of metrics more complicated
than this. So, what's special about special relativity is that you use
the metric appropriate for flat space as opposed to the many other
different kinds of metrics that you can use in general relativity,
which has a much more general form for the metric.</p>

<p>I should say, you can also write this down. You can write down the
spatial terms here in polar coordinates. Remember polar coordinates?
Polar coordinates, you describe the position in space, instead of with
<i>x, y, Z,</i> you describe it with a radius, a distance from zero,
and some angles. And it turns out, that's convenient to do so. Let me
write this down in polar coordinates, or in polar. That's an <i>r</i>.
Let me write that explicitly. This is an Omega, that's some angle. And
then the <i>T</i> thing remains the same. And I've pulled a little bit
of a notational fast one on you here. I've gone away from the deltas
and I've written these down as <i>d</i>. This is the differential
<i>d</i>. Those of you who have taken some calculus will remember this.
If this were a calculus-based course I would explain why I did that,
but I'm not going to. So, just allow me this slight of hand, here. For
technical reasons, these have to be differential. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> But you do need a second angle term for the
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> I do need a second angle term. I
should say--good point. You need two angles and a distance in three
space. This capital Omega here is actually--Omega squared is actually
sin θ, <i>d</i> θ, <i>d</i> φ, which is the correct form. And so you
could write out both terms here, but in fact, this one isn't going to
change. But you're absolutely right. In principle, you need two
angles.</p>

<p>Okay, why have I done this? Excellent question. I ask myself a
question at this point. Where am I going? What I want to do now is
write down a different metric. A metric that actually involves curved
space and the presence of a mass. And this is something called the
Schwarzschild metric. Remember Schwarzschild? He had a radius. And this
is the appropriate metric for the presence of a single point mass at
the center of the coordinate system, at <i>R</i> = 0. That's why I put
it into polar coordinates, because the presence of the mass is going to
change the space-time as a function of distance--from radial distance
from where the mass is. And so, it's much more convenient for the
Schwarzschild metric to use this in polar coordinates.</p>

<p>So, here's the Schwarzschild metric, (<i>d T<sup>2</sup></i>),
that's the--this is the interval, is equal to (<i>dR)</i> / (1 -
<i>R</i><sub>s</sub> / <i>R</i>). So, that's just like the flat term,
except with something in the denominator there. Plus
<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>d</i> Omega squared, that's just like the flat
metric. And then the--whoops this had better be - <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>
(1 - <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> / <i>R</i>) (<i>cT</i>) <sup>2</sup>. Where
<i>R</i><sub>S</sub> is the Schwarzschild radius, which we've had
before, which is 2<i>GM</i> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Okay, so this is just like the flat metric with two exceptions. It's
got a term in the radial part of this 1 - <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> /
<i>R</i>. And it's got that same term, but this time in the numerator,
in the time term here. Now, what do you do with this--with such an
equation? Well, we've done--in special relativity, we've dealt with
these kinds of things. What you do is you start taking the limiting
cases. You say, okay, what happens when it's getting really close to
flat on the one hand, and what's happening when it's getting very
seriously relativistic on the other hand? So let's do that.</p>

<p>If <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> / <i>R</i> goes to zero, then the metric
turns into the flat metric. Because if <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> / <i>R</i>
= 0, this term disappears because it's 1 - 0, and it just cancels. This
term disappears and you recover the flat metric. This happens in two
cases. If the mass goes to zero, then <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> goes to
zero, and you recover the flat metric. Or if <i>R</i> gets really big,
then <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> / <i>R</i> goes to zero, and again, you
recover the flat metric. So in--there are two situations where
Schwarzschild metric blends smoothly into the ordinary flat space. One
is if the mass is zero, that's not surprising. If the mass is zero then
space-time isn't curved. Or alternatively, if you're really, really far
away from the mass. If <i>R</i> is much, much bigger than the
Schwarzschild radius, you're way out there. There's no gravitational
effect. Space-time remains flat. So, these the--this is the limiting
case where you recover special relativity.</p>

<p>Now, the other case is when <i>R</i> gets close to the Schwarzschild
radius and approaches it. So then 1 - <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> / <i>R</i>
approaches zero, because these two are going to get closer and closer
together. 1 - 1 = 0. What happens then? So, this is now, first of
all--in physical terms you're getting really close to the Schwarzschild
radius. So now, what happens to the metric if you do that? The
<i>dR</i> term gets very big, because it's got a zero in the
denominator. The <i>dT</i> term gets really small, because it's got
that thing that's going to zero in the numerator.</p>

<p>Fine. What does that mean? Well, remember, this is the negative
term. This is the positive term. So the positive term is getting
really, really big. The negative term is getting really, really small.
And that means that all intervals are gradually becoming space-like.
What do I mean by that? Well, the negative term is getting small. One
of the positive terms is getting big. So the sum of those tends to be
positive. It's becoming more and more positive. Positive intervals are
these space-like intervals, and you can't communicate or travel across
space-like intervals. When you get all the way to the Schwarzschild
radius, this blows up completely, becomes infinite. This becomes zero,
and there are no time-like intervals.</p>

<p>There are no time-like intervals that cross the event horizon.
That's why you can't get out. This takes us back to the basic principle
of black holes.</p>

<p>So, cannot communicate or travel over space-like intervals. And so,
you can't cross <i>R</i> equals the Schwarzschild radius. All right.
Let's see. Let me write the thing down again, here, for you. Okay, so
that's the metric we're worrying about here.</p>

<p>And now, let's think about what happens inside the Schwarzschild
radius. <i>R</i> less than <i>R</i><sub>Schwarzschild</sub>. That means
the <i>dR</i> term becomes negative, because 1 - <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> /
<i>R</i>. If <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> is bigger than <i>R</i> then this
term is--this term is greater than 1, and this whole thing is less than
zero, and the signs change. And the <i>dT</i> term becomes positive.
So, that means this is the time-like term, where this one is the
space-like term, because it's positive.</p>

<p>That's what I meant three, four, five lectures ago, when I said that
inside the Schwarzschild radius, when you're inside the Schwarzschild
radius, space and time reverse. It's a sign change in the metric.
That's what it means. And you can only travel along negative intervals.
That means you have to move in <i>R</i> the same way outside the
Schwarzschild radius you have to move in <i>T</i>. But notice it's only
the radial term. This term hasn't changed. You could go around in
circles, but whatever you do, you still have to move, as it turns out,
toward the center of the thing in radius, in order to have a time-like
interval. And so, motion in <i>R</i> is required for inside the
Schwarzschild radius, whereas motion in <i>T</i> is required outside.
So space and time reverse.</p>

<p>All of which is very nice, but I've left out something--I've left
something out, which is the fact--inside the event horizon, how do you
know that this is still the metric? One could invent some function that
looks just like this outside the Schwarzschild radius, but then looks
like something else inside the Schwarzschild radius. And because no
communication across the Schwarzschild radius is possible, you'd never
be able to test it. And so, this is how one gets away with doing
non-testable physics. You say, well, we're just going to assume that
the metric hasn't changed. Why should it change? After all, it's the
same equation. But inside the Schwarzschild radius you can't actually
test this.</p>

<p>Outside the Schwarzschild radius you can test it, because you see
whether objects behave as they ought to behave in a space that's curved
in this particular way--in a space-time that's curved in this
particular way. And so, this is what I meant by, five classes ago, by
saying space and time reverse. These two quantities reverse their
signs.</p>

<p>All right, that's as far as we can go, because the next thing that
one would want to do is, you find out what the equation is for finding
out how things move in these curved space-times. Basically, you
remember, things go from one event to another in the shortest possible
path, that's the equivalent of a straight line. That means if you
integrate over <i>d</i>T, it has to be minimized. So, you minimize this
integral. That tells you how things move. We're not going to do that.
Sighs of relief? And because--for obvious reasons. So, this is as far
as we can go, just to write down the metric here. So, let me know pause
for questions, and then we're going to go back and talk about
astronomy--about things in the sky that actually exhibit these
relativistic behaviors. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You were talking before about intervals, and how all
the intervals are negative. What exactly is one interval?
[Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Sorry?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What exactly is one interval? [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Oh, an interval. So, what I'm doing
is I'm taking two events, each of which is one of these points in
space-time, and I'm asking, "What is the interval between them?" What
is--you could measure the distance between them, you could measure the
time from one event to another. But as it turns out, those aren't
invariants. And so, there's this other thing, the metric, which is
invariant. And so, that's a measure--an invariant measure of how
separated these two events are. So, you take two events and you ask
yourself, "Are they separated by zero, a positive quantity or a
negative quantity?" Where by separation, I mean, this curious
combination of space and time.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So the intervals are before the metric, before the
interval?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Yeah, it's an interval--think
of--let me go back to the analogy I started with. Here's--in two
spatial dimensions, <i>x</i> and <i>x</i>, here are two points. And
depending on how I set the coordinate system up, the
<i>x</i>-distance--the <i>x</i> difference between them and the
<i>y</i> difference between them can change, but the distance is always
the same. So now, I've got two points with--each with and <i>x, y,
Z</i> and a <i>T.</i> And depending on how I change my velocity or my
coordinates the particular values of <i>x, y</i>, <i>Z</i>, and
<i>T</i> can change, but this (Δ T<sup>2</sup>) defined by--I'm in flat
space now, right? This separation, this interval between those two
points, this is the invariant--in the same way that the distance
between two points doesn't change if you change the coordinate system,
even though the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> separations do.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> It gives you--no. Well, it combines
these four things into one thing that doesn't change. That's the point.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is there a way that you can--like as an interval
from zero basically describes two events that appear simultaneous?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> As the--yeah exactly.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So, is that then collapsed into a Newtonian theory,
things with two--things appear simultaneously if they happen at the
same time --</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Well okay. So, there's two
different ways things can appear, quote, simultaneously. One is if they
are two different events in space-time and light travels from one, and
they're exactly separated by--the amount of time between them is the
same as the distance between them if you multiply by
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. They can also appear simultaneously if they are
the same point as each other. And then everything goes to zero. And
it's only in that second case that it--that the Newtonian concept of
simultaneous kicks in. Simultaneous is usually taken to mean that the
time separation is zero. Two things happen simultaneously when they
happen at the same time.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> On Earth the--the distances and the
velocities and the gravitational fields are never so strong that you
have any trouble--that the Δ T changes significantly depending on what
your point of view is. So, in our everyday life, we have a strong
concept of simultaneity. It's two things that happen at the same time.
Turns out, though, that if you move at close to the speed--if you
observe two events to be at the same time and I'm moving at close to
the speed of light, I don't observe those two events at the same time,
even though you do. And so, at that point, you have to abandon the
Newtonian concept that Δ T = 0 tells you that two events are
simultaneous. And the whole concept of simultaneity takes on a
different task. Other questions, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [Inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Okay, so these units can be any
units of length you like provided that--any units of length you like,
provided the time units are related to it by <i>c</i>. That is to say,
if your distance units are light-years, your time units have to be
years. If your distance units are meters, then your time units are some
kind of meter, light-meter-second thing. And so, the only restriction
on the units you use is that the time and the space units have to be
convertible into each other through <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Or, alternatively, another way of saying it is, you use any units
you like, and as long as you express the speed of light in those units.
If you have a time unit and a space unit, if you're in--if you're
measuring your space in furlongs and your time in fortnights, as long
as your <i>c</i> is in furlongs per fortnight, it's going to come out
okay. So, as long as it's convertible. Other questions?</p>

<p>Okay, if you don't get all the details and nuance of what I've said
this period, don't worry too much about it. I just wanted to get the
concept of the metric out there and show you how, if you look at that
equation these concepts of space and time reversing, and so forth, have
a kind of mathematical consequence, as well as just spouting words. And
if you get, sort of, the basic outline of the argument, that's
fine.</p>

<p>Okay, back to actual things in actual--that actually exist. So, what
I want to talk about now is evidence for general relativity from
astronomical objects--real black holes, stuff like that. Now, one of
the curious things about this is that when Einstein thought all this
stuff up, he thought it up from basically these philosophical concerns
about mass – that the inertial mass turned out to always be equal to
the gravitational mass. Why would that be? And there wasn't, when he
thought it up, a great body of evidence for his theory in the real
world.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to special relativity. Special relativity, there
were all these experiments that needed to be explained. General
relativity--very, very little. In fact, when Einstein first put forward
the theory in 1917, there was only one thing that had ever been
observed that actually showed an effect of general relativity, and that
was the orbit of Mercury, which you're reading about for this week's
problem set.</p>

<p>So, just going back a little bit, in the nineteenth century, people
had observed the orbits of planets in great detail. And they found out
that two of the planets were moving in ways they couldn't quite
explain. There were very small deviations from the predictions orbit.
In particular, the orbit of Uranus was a little weird. And that was
quickly explained by the presence of an unknown--hitherto unknown
planet, which was also exerting a gravitational force on Uranus and
pulling it out of the orbit that it should have been, by a very small
amount, because the gravitational force of another planet is very small
compared to that of the Sun. But by the middle of the nineteenth
century they could measure such things. And they therefore predicted
the presence of this other planet, of Neptune, and they calculated
where it should be. And some guy went off and observed in that spot and
found it--predicted presence of Neptune and discovered it in the
predicted place. Big triumph! Everybody--if they had had Nobel Prizes
back then, they would have won it for this, for sure. And then, there
was a whole big kerfuffle because they couldn't decide whether the
French guy had done it before the English guy, or vice versa. And they
argued with each other for decades about who gets the credit. But in
scientific terms, there was a prediction, and the prediction was
verified. Excellent news.</p>

<p>Now, there was also a problem with the orbit of Mercury--also
perturbed, from what you would expect. And having had this big triumph
in the Outer Solar System, they figured, well, we know how to deal with
this. There's got to be another planet in there. So, they predict the
presence of a planet called Vulcan, which then disappears from the
scientific literature until it's resurrected by Star Trek. But
Vulcan--the concept of Vulcan was, this was going to be a planet that's
closer to the Sun than Mercury. That's why they haven't been able to
find it, because it's too near the Sun to be easily observed. And it's
going to pull on Mercury in such a way that it's going to explain the
problems with the orbit of Mercury. And so, they then look for Vulcan
in the predicted place, and they find it. And then somebody else finds
it. And they find it many times and each time it's different--all
different.</p>

<p>And it gradually becomes clear that everybody's fooling themselves.
That there's no--this is a really hard observation to make, right?
Because the thing is right near to the Sun. And so, it turns out that
all of this is wrong. None of these observations are really any good.
It's not repeatable--so, not really.</p>

<p>And so, after some attempts to find Vulcan--and then, they rule out
the presence of Vulcan in various places. So, then the people
calculating the orbits have to go back and say, well, if Vulcan isn't
there, maybe there are two or three planets combining together to do
the thing that we originally wanted Vulcan to do. This gets sort out of
control after a while. And at a certain point, people just kind of give
up, and they say, well, it's a great big mystery about Mercury. And
after a while, after that, people kind of even stopped caring. Because,
you know, we know Newton's laws worked. This is just some weirdness
about Mercury that we don't understand.</p>

<p>And then, when Einstein creates his new theory of gravity, he then
computes in the new theory of Mercury's orbit. And he now gets
something that agrees with the observations, without the need for a new
planet. And so, what happened was, Mercury's orbit is a little
different from the Newtonian prediction. The general relativity
prediction is a little bit different in just the same way to explain
this problem that people had been trying to solve for fifty years
unsuccessfully. And so, this was the first verification, empirical
verification, of general relativity. And if you think about it, you
would expect that Mercury would be the place you would find this
out.</p>

<p>For Mercury, <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> / <i>R</i>, this is the
Schwarzschild radius of the Sun because that's what's doing the
gravitating, is the biggest in the Solar System. Because the <i>R</i>,
the distance from Mercury to the Sun, is the smallest of any of the
planets in the Solar System. And so, the relativistic effects, the
general relativity effects, are relatively large. But, you know, this
is still a really small number. This is 3 kilometers, the Schwarzschild
radius of the Sun. Mercury is way out there somewhere.</p>

<p>So, even though this is the most--this is the biggest relativistic
effect in the Solar System, it still isn't that huge. Let me just
remind you what this effect is. Here's the Sun. Mercury's going around
the Sun. And it's going around in a slightly elliptical orbit. I'm
going to draw a very elliptical orbit, here, but it's really not that
big. And there's a point in the orbit where it is closest to the Sun.
That point is called the perihelion. "Peri" for close, "helios" for
Sun--of Mercury. And in the Newtonian theory, you should have exactly
the same orbit every time. You should come back and the perihelion
should be in the same place in each successive orbit. The orbit doesn't
move or doesn't change.</p>

<p>But, in general relativity, the perihelion moves. So, after a while
the perihelion will be here. The whole orbit will kind of tip this way,
and it'll look like this. So, this is the perihelion later. And it
looks like that. And the angle which the perihelion makes with the Sun
has changed. This angle is called the angle of the perihelion. And this
precesses. So this is called the precession of the perihelion. And it's
measured in some angle per time. Because the question is, "How long
does it take for the perihelion to precess across some angle?" And the
key number for Mercury is 43 arc seconds. Remember arc seconds? Those
are small angles. Per century – a really small movement, but something
that can be measured, and had been measured. And it's not surprising
that this is small, because the relativistic effects are going to be
small, because the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is really small
compared to the size of the orbit of Mercury.</p>

<p>But this was observed before Einstein made his theory. Nobody
understood it. Einstein came up with his theory. It turned out it
predicted a precession of the perihelion in a way that Newton didn't,
and it turned out to work out precisely. So, that was good. And at the
time Einstein published the theory, this was the only piece of evidence
that it was correct. Pretty small empirical verification.</p>

<p>And so, let's just write down the fable, here. This is Einstein and
the precession of the perihelion. And there are two versions of the
moral. Sometimes in textbooks, you know, they make a big deal out of
this. They say, oh, there was this terrible problem with Mercury, and
then Einstein came along with this great new theory, solved that
problem. In the same way that they say, there was this terrible problem
with the speed of light being constant from all frames, and Einstein
came along with special relativity and solved that problem. That's a
misreading of history.</p>

<p>This was a by-product of Einstein. It wasn't that there was a
problem with the data and he went out to try and fix the theory to
conform with the data. There was very little data. So, the moral here
is aesthetic considerations, aesthetic--perhaps you want to call this
philosophical, considerations can lead to a good new theory because he
didn't really do it to explain the data.</p>

<p>This is, however, the only time I can think of where this actually
happened this way. Every other major advance in science came about
because the observers or the experimenters had a problem--but not G.R.
Only for general relativity.</p>

<p>Now, subsequent to that, between 1917, when this theory was
promulgated, and now, there have been a variety of tests of general
relativity using astronomical objects. You always have to use
astronomical--or almost always have to use astronomical objects to test
this, because you need really strong gravitational fields, and it's
hard to produce a really strong gravitational field in the laboratory.
You're kind of limited to what the Earth provides you with, and that
isn't such a strong gravitational field. We computed, at some point,
the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth, <i>R</i> /
<i>R</i><sub>Schwarzschild</sub> is the relevant quantity, and it's
really small from the Earth's gravitational field. So, it's hard to see
these things. So, all these tests tend to be astronomical in nature.
Since then, a variety of tests of G.R., and the punch line is that it
passes all of them. G.R. is still a good theory. There's no
contradictory data. But the tests still aren't as strong as you might
have hoped they would be. And we'll talk about some of those on
Thursday.</p>
