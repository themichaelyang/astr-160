<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Just in time for our last class, we
get this in yesterday's <i>New York Times</i>, and all over the rest of
the media. "New Planet Could Be Earth-like." You know, every time they
get a new planet, it's always Earth-like, but this one might really be
true. It was found by the standard Doppler shift method, which you guys
all remember, and turns out to be the lowest mass planet that's been
discovered in that particular way.</p>

<p>And so, as a kind of final farewell calculation, I thought we'd
check the <i>New York Times</i>' numbers on this. You can go back and
read the article for yourself. The information given there is that the
orbital period is about 13 days. The distance between the planet and
its star – that's the semi-major axis – is given as 7 million miles.
These are, of course, not the world's best set of units. The distance
to the system is 20 light-years. That's really close. Somebody's quoted
in the article as saying, you know, we could go there. Not so much. And
I looked up the apparent magnitude of this star, which turns out to be
about 10.5.</p>

<p>And so, what can we do with information of this kind? Well, let's
first put this into some kind of sane set of units, here. Thirteen days
is--let's see. Three days is--3.5 days would be 1% of a year. So, this
is, like, 3 x 10<sup>-2</sup> of a year. Seven million miles. That's
something like 10 million kilometers, 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;kilometers,
which is 10<sup>10</sup> meters. So, that's something like 7 x
10<sup>-2</sup> Astronomical Units. And you know right away what to do
with that, or, at least, you will if you go back in your notes for a
few months.</p>

<p>This is in good units to use <i>a</i><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;=
<i>P</i><sup>2</sup> <i>M</i>. <i>M</i>, then, shows up in solar
masses. So let's figure out the mass of this star. Let's see, (7 x
10<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>3</sup> / (3 x 10<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>.
That'll be the mass in solar masses.</p>

<p>7 x 7 = 50, times 7 is 350, times 10<sup>-6</sup> over 10 x
10<sup>-4</sup> [(350 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) / (10 x 10<sup>-4</sup>)].
That's 35 x 10<sup>-2</sup>.</p>

<p>.35, which is 1/3. Okay? So, this star is 1/3 of the mass of
Sun--perfectly respectable mass for a star to be.</p>

<p>And then--let's see. Let's do something else. It's 20 light-years
away. Twenty light years, that's something like 6 parsecs. So, it's
really nearby, as these things go. Not that you would want to take a
spaceship and go there or anything, but it is one of the closer stars.
And then, we can do this thing. We can figure out the absolute
magnitude of this star. I've written down the apparent magnitude. So,
that's that equation. Let's see.</p>

<p>5 log (6/10). Let's call that 2 x 3 x 10<sup>-1</sup>, yeah? That's
6/10 - five.</p>

<p>And then, you know, this thing about logs, if you multiply them
inside the bracket, you can add them outside the bracket. So, this is
log of 2, plus log of 3, plus log of 10<sup>-1</sup>. Log of
10<sup>-1</sup> is -1, and the other two, I happen to know. The log of
2&nbsp;is .3. The log of 3 is .5. Minus one, that's 5 x -.2 = -1. And
so, 10.5 minus the absolute magnitude would be -1.</p>

<p>Let's see. How's this going to work? This has to go over there. That
has to come over here. Absolute magnitude, 11.5. Now, you may remember
that the Sun has a magnitude--an absolute magnitude of around 5. So,
this is much, much fainter than the Sun. That's good, because it's less
massive than the Sun, and low mass stars get faint really quickly. How
much fainter? Well, we know how to do that, right?</p>

<p>Let's see, that looks--in the easiest format, it looks like this:
<i>M</i><sub>star</sub> - <i>M</i><sub>sun</sub> =
<i>b</i><sub>star</sub> / <i>b</i><sub>sun</sub>. This a minus sign out
here in front? Yes. So, that's 10<sup>-2/5 (11.5 - 5)</sup>, which is
equal to 10<sup>(-2/5)(6.5)</sup>. All right, what are we going to do
about that?</p>

<p>6.5 over –</p>

<p>65/5 = 13. So, this is 10<sup>-1.3 x 2</sup>.</p>

<p>2.6. You could work it out.</p>

<p>And that, in turn, is equal to--remember, this is
<i>b</i><sub>star</sub> / <i>b</i><sub>sun</sub>, brightness of the
star over brightness of the Sun. That's 10<sup>0.4</sup> x
10<sup>-3</sup>; 3+; 3 + .4; - 2.6 and that's – oh, I don't know, what,
2.5 at a guess, times 10<sup>-3</sup>. A tiny fraction of the
brightness of the Sun. Less than 1% as bright as the Sun.</p>

<p>And this is the importance of the discovery. Because it's in a
13-day orbit. It's really quite close to the star. We figured out how
close. It's 7%. The distance of the Earth to the Sun is this planet
from its star. But the star is much fainter too. And so, if you do the
little calculation, which is quite straightforward to do – we won't do
it here – of how much energy this planet receives from its star,
compared to the amount of energy that the Earth receives from the Sun,
you get almost exactly the same answer. So, here is a planet whose
surface temperature is likely to be quite similar to that of Earth.
Here is a planet where liquid water could exist.</p>

<p>Now, we don't actually know that much about this planet except for
its mass. It's five times the mass of the Sun--sorry, five times the
mass of the Earth. That could be either a big Earth or a small Neptune,
and those are quite different objects. And we don't really know what
category, from that point of view, it's in. It seems unlikely that it
would be a big Earth, because this is a low-mass star. It's also, as it
turns out, a low-metallicity star. So, it's got only 1/3 the stuff of
the Sun, and it's got less than 1/2 the frequency of heavy materials as
the Sun. And so, it's hard to imagine it could build up a rocky planet
five&nbsp;times bigger than the Earth, but you never know. Stranger
things than that have happened, and will probably happen again, in
astronomy. So, you don't know what will happen with this one.</p>

<p>There's rumors going around, I should say, that there are even more
entertaining planets going to be announced in the next few weeks, so,
keep your eye on the newspapers. There may, in fact, be more to come.
Okay, so that's the last calculation, here. You just never know when
these things will show up in the newspaper. Okay.</p>

<p>What we're going to do on Monday and Tuesday, we're going to do this
double strength section--sorry? Monday and Wednesday. Thank you. We
decided not to do the Tuesday one. We've got you guys all sectioned. I
think there was an email yesterday, which told you what section you're
in. If you have any problems with that, you know, make sure we know
about it in advance. And later, well, probably Saturday, or so, I will
post three pages of instructions. You don't have to read them
particularly carefully, but I would like you to download them and print
them and to bring them with you to the class.</p>

<p>Let me take you through the first page of this. Here we go.
Cosmology: The Game. And let me just take you through the sequence of
play, so you know approximately what will happen. So, at the start of
the game, everybody gets a role. You can be a junior or a senior
scientist at one of several competing scientific institutions, or a
member of the review committee that decides which projects to do. Each
of the competing institution then proposes a project and a funding
request. The senior scientist has to present the case. The review
committee then gets to decide. And so, you can't do all of them. You
can only do some of them. So, the review committee decides what
projects to approve and they give either partial or a full funding, and
then, they report why they have made the decisions they make. And then,
we tell you what the results of that scientific exploration is.</p>

<p>So, you know, you go out and you try and find more supernovae and we
tell you that--I don't know what happens. Magically, all the supernovae
have disappeared, or they're all way, way, way too bright, or whatever
it is that the answer turns out to be. And then, you know a little bit
more about the Universe.</p>

<p>At that point, the review committee, which is made up of aging
pundits, all die off. The senior scientists are promoted to the review
committee. The junior scientists are promoted to senior scientists, and
the review committee are reborn as junior scientists, or something like
that. And so, we sort of cycle through all the roles. And you keep
going through these cycles until you figure out what the dark matter
and what the dark energy is. And then, at the end, we will sort of
debrief, and decide what the key moment of discovery was, and award a
suitable simulation of the Nobel Prize. It was M&amp;Ms last year, but
we'll see.</p>

<p>So, that's approximately what's going to happen. And the key thing
is what kind of projects can you propose? And the other two pages of
this handout are going to be a list of potential projects that you can
propose. You can also propose anything else you can think of, and we
will invent results on the spot for any other kinds of projects that
get approved as well. But I figured it would be a good idea for you to
have, at least, a range of possibilities of things you might consider
proposing, and why.</p>

<p>So, that will be posted on Saturday. My experience is that in just
under two hours, you can figure out all the secrets of the Universe in
this particular--well, of a Universe that I design, which is, you know,
not as sophisticated, perhaps, as the real Universe will turn out to
be. Okay, procedural questions on any of that? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So, the Universe that we're looking at isn't going
to be like the actual Universe as an exercise?</p>

<p><b>Professor Charles Bailyn:</b> Who knows? Since I don't know what
the actual Universe is, it would be a little hard to give you the
actual Universe as an exercise. What I have done is I have invented a
Universe, which is consistent with everything we know now, and has many
more answers than we know now. I would be very, very fortunate, indeed,
if that turned out to have anything to do with the real Universe. So, I
wish it were true that I had those kinds of powers. But it's possible.
That's the key. Other questions?</p>

<p>Okay. So, last time, we ended on kind of an optimistic note. I had
written down this plot, which was a plot of Ω<sub>λ</sub> versus
Ω<sub>m</sub>, going from 0 to 1 and beyond. And I put down--I showed
you the plot of three lines on this plot, which is the lines indicated
by different kinds of cosmological observations. So, the supernovae,
which we've talked about a lot, force you to be on a line something
like that in the plot. So, this is where the supernovae observation
kind of forces you to be.</p>

<p>And then, the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background force
the sum of these two quantities to be one. And so, you end up with
something that looks like that from the Cosmic Microwave Background.
And then, by comparing simulations of the growth of clustering to the
actual clusters of galaxies that we observe in the Universe, there
turns out to be a third line, and it looks like this. So, this comes
from clustering. Is that legible? Close enough.</p>

<p>Okay. And so, the great thing about this was, if you will recall,
that there were three different lines on a two-dimensional graph, and
they all cross at the same point. And this constitutes a test of the
theory, because it is not necessarily true that if you put down three
lines at random in a two-dimensional space that they will all cross at
the same point. And so, the fact that they do makes you think that
something about how we understand what's going on is going pretty much
right. Because there's no reason for these things to cross at a point.
We predict that they do because you know they're all measuring the same
Universe but in different ways. And so, the fact that they do lend some
credence to this whole wonderful set of stories.</p>

<p>But there's another way of looking at this plot, which is to look at
what these axes are. What are we actually plotting on this plot? This Ω
that shows up is the ratio of the density of something to the critical
density of the Universe. So, this axis is, effectively, the density of
the dark matter. And this axis, here, is the density of the dark
energy. So, what we are plotting in this wonderful plot where
everything works out so nicely is the density of something we don't
know anything about versus the density of some other thing that we
don't know anything about. And so, in a certain sense, the fact that
we're working--regardless of where the lines are, the fact that we've
got these two axes means we don't have any idea what's going on.</p>

<p>So, that's perhaps the more pessimistic view. And, you know,
thinking about this, you get a kind of faint odor of epicycles.
Remember epicycles? Epicycles, I talked about in the very first class,
your very first lecture of this class. This is the business back in the
Middle Ages, where they thought the Earth was still the center of the
Universe, and they were trying to figure out what was going on with the
orbits of the planets. And they discovered that a single circle for
each planet didn't do the job. It didn't concord with what the
observations were.</p>

<p>So, they said, all right, well, you know, the Earth's the center of
the Universe, and we know everything has to be a circle. So, we'll put
circles on top of circles. And then, they were able to match the
observations. But then, the observations got better and they had to
have ever more complicated circles on top of circles. So, let me--so,
that was the story of epicycles back in the Middle Ages. And then, of
course, what it turned out is that the idea that the Earth was the
center of the Universe, and the idea that everything goes in circles is
just wrong. And as soon as you abandon those two ideas, and have the
idea that the planets go in ellipses around the Sun, all of a sudden,
everything gets much simpler and it's all explained.</p>

<p>So, what's happening in cosmology now? We're observing the motions
of galaxies and of objects within galaxies, like supernovae that we can
see. And the first thing we found out is that the rotation of galaxies
and other indicators of matter aren't in accord with what we expect, so
we invent dark matter to explain the internal motions of galaxies and
galaxy clusters.</p>

<p>We then discover that the external motion, the motion of these
things through the Universe, also doesn't accord with what we would
have expected, so we invent dark energy in order to explain that. So,
we've now, in the past twenty-five years, invented two different, but
completely imaginary, as far as we know, concepts, to fill 96% of the
Universe with, to figure out what's going on with the fact that the
motions we observe are not the motions we expect.</p>

<p>How many more? You know, let's go out and measure some more things,
then maybe we'll need dark something else. And dark something else
after that. And maybe it needs to change with time. And maybe it needs
to magically appear halfway through the history of the Universe, or
something like that. Who knows? You know, if you keep inventing these
things, of course, you can explain anything you like, just in exactly
the same way that if you have enough epicycles, you can have a model
with the Earth at the center of the Universe that explains all the
motions of the planets you see. If you get to just keep inventing words
here, of course, you can explain the Universe.</p>

<p>And, you know, what would have happened if this line didn't come
across? Supposing that line had been out there. What would you have
done? What you would have said is, well, of course, we don't understand
dark energy. So, we've just proved that dark energy varies with time,
or varies spatially, or becomes opaque at large distances, or some
other quality. And then, we would have rewritten this graph so that
they do cross. That's not very compelling.</p>

<p>And indeed, it has gotten sufficiently embarrassing that there is
now just beginning to be a feeling that maybe what's going on is we
need new laws of physics. Maybe we're at a moment like the end of the
sixteenth century, or the end of the nineteenth century, where the
current basic ideas that we base our theories of the Universe on are
about to be radically transformed. That's possible.</p>

<p>It's also possible that we'll wake up three years from now and see
in the newspaper that someone has discovered what the dark matter is.
And that three years after that, we will wake up and read in the
newspaper that some scientists have developed a good string theory that
entirely predicts exactly how the dark energy is going to behave.</p>

<p>I think, in general, it's always a good idea to bet on standard
physics, rather than revolutionary, new ideas. But, if you keep at it
for a quarter of a century, as we have, in looking for the dark matter,
and keep finding nothing, you got to start to wonder.</p>

<p>And indeed, there was a radical theory, proposed a few years back,
about the dark matter in particular, that there is no dark matter. It's
just, we don't understand the laws of gravity. And so, you know, we had
to modify the laws of gravity for very high gravitational fields. That
turned out to be relativity. And they suggested that you also need to
modify the laws of gravity for very low gravitational fields--the kinds
of things you feel at the edge of a galaxy, from the galaxy. And they
figured out how you would have to do that in order to explain the
orbits of galaxies without using any dark matter. This is called MOND,
for Modified Newtonian Dynamics. And I don't think that--it's become
clear that that particular theory probably isn't going to go anywhere,
for various reasons. It doesn't seem to be self-consistent. But
nevertheless, this was seriously proposed.</p>

<p>It was also, I have to say, a little philosophically dubious,
because if you want a new theory of gravity, you don't want to go back
to Newton and start over again. You probably want to start with
relativity and move on. But they made it consistent with relativity.
They worked out all the stuff and it seemed to work okay, except, it
turns out, it disagrees with observations, also.</p>

<p>But it was a real attempt to imagine that these things might really
turn out to be epicycles. And if there isn't progress in finding out
what's going on, I think we're going to see more of that as time goes
on. And it may be that in fifty years, these things will look like what
we think about people who thought that the Earth was the center of the
Universe. So, we'll see.</p>

<p>Now, there is one additional thing that we know about the Universe.
In addition to, you know, these three lines, which are kind of the
basic information that we currently have. And that is--so, here's
another fact about the Universe, kind of an obvious one. The fact is
that we exist. Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this conversation,
right? And what does that tell you about the Universe? It tells you the
fact that life exists, and in particular, what we grandiosely refer to
as intelligent life, exists.</p>

<p>Let's see. What do you require the Universe to have if life is going
to exist? It needs a couple of things. We can get into a whole argument
about life as we know it, and whether you can make it out of silicon
instead of out of carbon, or whether you can have life made entirely
out of neutrons on the surface of a neutron star, or something like
that. But no matter how you slice it, it's got to have some complexity
to it. You've got to have a lot of moving parts one way or another. You
have to have information flowing back and forth. You can't make a
living creature out of nothing but helium atoms.</p>

<p>Helium, you may remember from chemistry, is a noble gas. It doesn't
interact. It can't form structures. And if you had nothing but helium,
there would certainly be no life because there would just be a bunch of
helium atoms that don't interact with each other. If you made the
Universe entirely out of WIMPs, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles,
that just, kind of, fly past each other and don't pay any attention to
each other, you're not going to have anything like life, because
there's no complexity.</p>

<p>It probably also needs some time to evolve. It took a while. If you
start--there's this wonderful experiment where you take a whole bunch
of stuff that was supposed to be in the oceans of the early Earth. And
you put it in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, and you keep sending
electricity through it, simulating lightening strikes. If you keep at
that for long enough, you can make things that seem like some of the
simpler amino acids. So, you just keep flashing lightening at the ocean
and you hope that you eventually--you build up life. Maybe yes, maybe
no. But, certainly it takes a long time.</p>

<p>And once you have somehow, magically, out of this process of
self-replicating viruses or something like that, then, you got to stick
around for a few billion years while evolution takes hold and makes
bigger and bigger and more and more complex structures. So, you have to
have a certain amount of time to allow this process to go forward.</p>

<p>So, for example, supposing it were true that Ω<sub>λ</sub>, that's
the density of the dark energy, instead of being around .7, was greater
than 100. So, the whole Universe is being pushed apart by this stuff,
and there's hundreds of times more of it than there is in the current
Universe. You're not going to form any structure. We looked at the
formation of structure last time. You just push the Universe apart
really fast, and you never get galaxies, or stars, or anything like
that, because there's too much dark energy to let them congeal. So,
push Universe apart--no structure. So, that would be a Universe that's
very unlikely to have any kind of complexity and any kind of life,
because you just take all these individual particles and push them far
away from each other.</p>

<p>Supposing it were true that the density of matter is significantly
less than 10<sup>-2</sup>. So, instead of having 1/3 of the critical
density, it has less than 1% of the critical density. Then, you've got
nothing to form the structures with. And so, the same thing happens.
Also, no structure.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the matter density is way up in the thousands
or the millions in this kind of scale, then everything collapses right
away back into a black hole. And again, there isn't a lot of structure
in a black hole. It's one single point in the center of the event
horizon.</p>

<p>So, we have no way of knowing what these numbers should be. But what
we do know is that we are fortunate that they happen to be in the
relatively narrow range, because if they weren't, we wouldn't exist.
This turns out to be true of most of the constants of nature.</p>

<p>For example, here's another example: the Schwarzschild radius.
Remember the Schwarzschild radius? The event horizon of a black hole,
given by 2<i>GM</i> / <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. Now, supposing you lived in
a Universe in which <i>G</i>, the constant of gravity, was
substantially bigger than it is in our Universe. If <i>G</i>&nbsp;were
bigger. And supposing you--in that same Universe, <i>c,</i> the speed
of light, were a good deal smaller than it is in our Universe. Just
some other--pick some other values out of a hat such that this is true.
Then, the Schwarzschild radius associated with any given mass would be
bigger, because both <i>G</i> is bigger, <i>c</i> is bigger, and then,
for the same amount of mass, you get a big Schwarzschild radius.</p>

<p>So, now, think about what happens if the Schwarzschild radius is
bigger than the radius of a white dwarf. Then, you never get white
dwarfs from neutron stars. All stars evolve when they run out of
nuclear fuel straight into black holes. All stars end as black
holes.</p>

<p>And the consequence of that is that the carbon that is made in stars
is never dispersed into the Universe, and you never end up with
planets. Because the next generation of stars is still made out of pure
hydrogen and helium, just like the first generation of stars was. And
you never end up with enough heavy elements--with any heavy elements.
And so, you can't form planets. So, no carbon, or anything other than
hydrogen and helium. And you're not going to make life out of hydrogen
gas and helium.</p>

<p>Now, carbon of course, this fabulous substance, does all this
wonderful chemistry. It forms rings. Does all this great stuff. That's
why organic chemistry, which is the chemistry of carbon, is more
complicated than the whole rest of all the other elements--chemistry of
all the other elements put together. And so, the properties of carbon
are very, very important for allowing complex structures to exist. So,
properties of carbon.</p>

<p>And it turns out that if you vary--would disappear, or not be able
to support these complex chains and complex carbon chemistry, would
disappear if the constants of nature, and in particular, something
called the fine structure constant, was even slightly different. It
also turns out you couldn't make the carbon in the first place, because
there's a property of the way the energy levels work in an atom that
allows the reaction of three helium atoms to fuse into a carbon atom,
to occur fast enough for that reaction to actually take place by a
substantial amount. So, it wouldn't take much messing around with the
constants of nature to make carbon either not exist, or have different
kinds of properties. You know, if carbon turns out to be just like
iron, and it just kind of sits there, you're, again, going to have some
trouble creating any kind of complex life.</p>

<p>So, we have this odd situation, in which it appears that drastic,
really quite drastic, fine-tuning of natural constants is a
pre-requisite for life. So, not any set of constants will do. In fact,
if you picked a random bunch of numbers for all these constants, almost
certainly, that would be a Universe with no complexity in it at
all.</p>

<p>And this gives rise to a set of ideas called, generally, the
Anthropic Principle, which is kind of the idea that the fact that life
exists, and people, in particular, is important for understanding
physics--for understanding basic physics. And the way I've just stated
that, you know, that seems kind of obvious, right? Of course, it has to
be true that the Universe is such that we can exist, because we know we
exist, and we're the ones who are studying the Universe. And so, just
in that form, it's not very interesting. But the implications of it
lead you in a wide variety of different philosophical directions.</p>

<p>So, the question is: why do all these constants, <i>G</i>, <i>c</i>,
λ, what have you, have the values they do? Okay. So, as I said, there
are a wide variety of different kinds of categories of answers to
this.</p>

<p>One is that it's just a big accident. You know, whatever it was that
set these numbers happened to pick a set of numbers that allowed life
to exist, and there's nothing to talk about because it's just a
complete accident. And it could just as easily have picked out some
other numbers. And even though most sets of numbers don't allow for the
existence of life, the one that's--the set of numbers that were somehow
determined by whatever mechanism determined, just kind of by accident,
produced a set of numbers that allows complexity to exist. Not very
satisfying approach because, among other things, if that's true, your
thinking stops dead right at that point. If you can attribute
everything to accident, you know, you just go on with your life.</p>

<p>Another, sort of the opposite of this, is to say it happened on
purpose. Life was created, if you want to use that term, or the
constants of nature that allow life to exist, are created on purpose.
And there is an obvious religious sub-category here, where you say that
there is a Creator, a god of some kind, who did this on purpose. So,
this leads to various kinds of religious explanations. But in more
general terms--and it doesn't have to be religious. This is what's
called the Strong Anthropic Principle, which says that for some reason,
be it religion or anything else, that the Universe must have life, or
have the set of constants that allows life to exist.</p>

<p>You know, one of the things that the physicists are trying to do is
to figure out why these numbers have the values they do. Maybe, it
turns out that if you finally work out the final theory of physics and
everything, that will tell you what these numbers have to be. And
there's only one choice that you can't choose randomly from these
numbers, that there's some theory that underlies, that requires you to
pick certain numbers, and that those numbers in turn require the
existence of life. And whether or not you attribute that to religious
causes, it doesn't make a difference to the sort of structure of this
kind of argument, that there's only way you could have made the
Universe.</p>

<p>Somebody phrased this, it might have been Einstein, I don't
remember, phrased it as: the question is, did God have a choice? Could
you have made a self-consistent Universe with some other set of
numbers? Maybe not.</p>

<p>But the version--the approach to this, which is getting the most
attention at the moment by the kinds of people who think about these
things, is the concept of the multiverse. Universe is one Universe.
Multiverse is many. So, the idea is that there are many Universes with
different sets of constants, sets of numbers. Numbers and laws.</p>

<p>Well, if that's true, then, things are pretty straightforward. If
you've got 100 jillion Universes out there, and each one has different
set of laws, a different manifestation of the laws of nature, then,
it's not surprising that the one we live in happens to be conducive for
our existence, because there's a whole bunch of other ones out there
that there are no people in. And naturally, we exist in the one case
where we can.</p>

<p>You know how this works. It's like going out into a parking lot, and
you see a license plate out in the parking lot. And the license plate
is 308 BJ6, or something like that. And you say, gosh, what a
coincidence. Out of all the license plates in the Universe, that one
happens to be sitting right in front of my office. But, of course, if
it was any other license plate, you would have said the same thing. And
so, that's actually not surprising.</p>

<p>So, similarly, if you have a whole lot of cars--of Universes in the
world, if you have--there are a whole lot of cars in the world, right?
There's billions of cars in the world. What are the odds that you get
into the one you own? Well, pretty high, right? Because you're doing it
on purpose. Similarly, if there's lots and lots of different Universes,
each one with a different set of physics, what are the odds that we
exist in one that allows us to exist? Pretty high.</p>

<p>But the question is, "Where do all these Universes come from?" And
so, how do you generate many different Universes? Why wouldn't you be
satisfied with just having the one you've got? And so, again, there are
a number of different sub-categories, here. There's the one in which
you look beyond the cosmic horizon.</p>

<p>Now, the cosmic horizon--you know, if the Universe is 13.7 billion
years old, we can't see anything more than 13.7 billion light years
away. And, in fact, the further away we look--we look back in time, so,
we certainly don't know anything about what something 13--what about
something 15 billion light years away is doing now. And so, you can
imagine that there are kind of slow changes in the constants and laws
of nature, and that by the time you're 100&nbsp;billion light years
away from us, that part of the Universe, which is causally disconnected
from our own, has some other kind of physics that is going on. And so,
you postulate an infinite Universe of which we can only detect ever, in
principle, a tiny fraction. And over there, somewhere, there's another
set of constants going on. And so, there's another set of physics far
away that we know nothing about. So that's one option.</p>

<p>Another option is other dimensions. Those of you who have read any
of the popular accounts of string theory may be aware that one of the
problems, or perhaps, advantages--well, the computer scientists call
these features, of string theory, is that you require either nine or
ten, or eleven, or perhaps twenty-six spatial dimensions, in order to
make it work out. Then, they do this clever thing where they say, of
course, we live in a three-dimensional Universe, but it's really a
ten-dimensional Universe with seven dimensions rolled up so tight you
can't see them. Kind of a dubious proposition, but it works out--it
actually works out quite well, mathematically.</p>

<p>But you could imagine that you're in a two-dimensional Universe. And
here's your Universe, but it's embedded inside some additional spatial
dimension. There could be another two-dimensional Universe down here,
and you would have no way of interacting with it. And so, you can
imagine that these extra dimensions that are being postulated allow the
existence of many different three-dimensional Universes, kind of, next
to each other, spread out in these higher dimensions. And perhaps they
don't all have to be three-dimensional Universes. They can be other
kinds. I mean, that's another crucial number, right--is how many
spatial dimensions your Universe has. And so, one could imagine that
these kinds of extra dimensions, talked about quite seriously by the
strength theorists, allow the existence of many different Universes
with different physical laws to choose from.</p>

<p>There's also a kind of evolutionary argument. This is presented in a
popular book by a guy named Lee Smolin, which is a wonderful book. I
want you to read it. His thought is that each time--and this came up, I
think, earlier in the class. Each time you make a black hole inside the
event horizon, a new Universe forms. So, that's one way of doing this.
So, new Universes form from old ones, from black holes, or
whatever.</p>

<p>And supposing you postulate that each daughter Universe has slightly
different parameters, but only slightly different, from its parent, in
the way that each of us has genetic material that's closely related,
but not identical to that of each of our parents. Well, what happens?
You, then, favor--in the idea that you may come out of black holes--
you favor Universes that produce lots of black holes.</p>

<p>And so, there's a kind of survival of the fittest--not just for
organisms, but for whole Universes. If you're the kind of Universe that
produces lots of black holes, you're going to have lots of children.
Then, after this goes on for a long time, most of the Universes in the
multiverse will be the kinds of Universes that produce lots of black
holes.</p>

<p>How do you make black holes? You make the most black holes by
producing lots and lots and lots of stars. Stars are complex objects.
This is the kind of Universe that you're likely to end up with life in.
And so Smolin's argument is that because of this survival of the
fittest for Universes as a whole, you're almost guaranteed that any
particular Universe you pick out is the kind of Universe that will
produce lots of black holes, and therefore, lots of complexity, and
therefore, will support life. And there are various other versions of
this same kind of thing.</p>

<p>And this is an attempt to, kind of, use the biological arguments for
how you get complexity on a cosmological scale. There's a difference,
of course. In the case of biology, we get to go back and look at the
fossil record, and we also understand genetics, so that we know how the
small modifications are created. I mean, you need a set of physical
laws, here, that tell you how different one Universe is from its
parents. And of course, that is not something we have any understanding
of, or knowledge of.</p>

<p>And this whole multiverse concept is now getting a lot of attention
from the people who worry about the philosophy of physics. And one of
the arguments that people get into over this kind of thing, which is
kind of an interesting one--people spend a lot of time that--people
worry about this spend a lot of time worrying about, is this science?
Smolin, by the way, thinks it is. He thinks that his idea of these
black holes makes a testable prediction--namely, that the current
Universe should be one that produces the most number of black holes of
any possible Universe. So, if you imagine changing the constants of
nature and doing a big simulation of what the Universe would look like
with that, then any other set of constants of nature would produce
fewer black holes than this Universe does.</p>

<p>I think that's actually problematic, because most stars in our
Universe don't produce black holes. So, you can think, well, tweak it
up so that they all make black holes. He then argues that that same
tweak changes star formation in such a way that you actually get fewer
stars to work with in the first place. Maybe so.</p>

<p>Other people argue that this is totally not science, because as soon
as you are invoking Universes other than our own, you've left the realm
of science, by definition. Because, what is the definition of science?
It's studying our own Universe in ways that you can actually test. And,
by definition, if you're talking about another Universe, it can't be
tested. So, this isn't science.</p>

<p>Other people say, well, look. Supposing you have some kind of a
theory which predicts things in our own Universe, which you can
observe, and also, the same theory predicts things about the
multiverse, which you can't observe. If you observe the things in our
Universe that you can predict correctly, then, that gives you some
confidence that the rest of the theory might also be right. And so,
this is a sort of intermediate case, where it's mostly science,
perhaps.</p>

<p>I have to say, I, personally, think it's the wrong question. Because
both sides of this argument presuppose the idea that if it's science,
that's good, and that if it isn't science, you shouldn't be talking
about it. Right? I think that's a problematic point of view. Just
between you, me, and the video camera back there, it's just not true
that things that aren't science aren't worth thinking about. There's
plenty of things that are worth thinking about that aren't science. And
my own personal view of this argument is that this is one of them--that
this really isn't science. But I don't care if it's science or not,
because it's still pretty interesting.</p>

<p>And I think we should also keep in mind that the border of what
science is and isn't has evolved rather quickly over the past 100
years, and this ought to be apparent from what we've talked about in
this course. Twenty years ago, talking about planets around other stars
was complete science fiction. They did it on Star Trek, but not in the
scientific journals. And this has, now, as we saw from the example this
morning, changed really, very dramatically.</p>

<p>Forty years ago, the idea that you would have black holes to
actually look at, that you could pour gas into them to see what
happens, was equally unscientific. A hundred years ago, the idea that
you could say anything scientific about the Universe as a whole was
completely preposterous. That was part of philosophy, not part of
science. And yet, over time, all of these things have been kind of
assimilated into science, and there's no reason to think that the kinds
of philosophical musings about the multiverse might not also, in some
way that we can't currently understand, be pulled into science.</p>

<p>And so, this whole argument over whether this is science or not
might be overtaken by events. And events are, after all, moving pretty
rapidly these days. This is a golden age of astrophysics because of the
instruments we have, the techniques we've developed, the theories we
have. You know, historians of science a thousand years from now will
say, the beginning of the twenty-first century, that's when it was all
discovered. And so, it's kind of a privilege for me to play some small
role in this, and to have the opportunity to talk to you guys about
it.</p>

<p>And so, I would say, whether or not you've learned anything
interesting about astrophysics, and whether or not you've learned
anything useful about the way science works, if you've acquired even a
fraction of the enthusiasm that I feel for this enterprise, then, I
think our time together has been more or less worthwhile. And so,
that's all I have to say. Thank you for your attention, and we will
meet next week.</p>
